## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on implementing the **Recurrence Flow**.
- Discussed **Payment Dummy Hops** issues with mentor and peers.

## Reflections

Today, I decided to take a meaningful pause from the endless loop of debugging
the Payment Dummy Hops and shift my focus to the **Recurrence Flow**.  
The task was clear: figure out the core components and their interactions to get
the _accepting payment_ flow working — from how the offer carries recurrence
data, to how the invoice request and subsequent requests are handled, stored,
and serialized.

It felt refreshing to work on something different yet equally intricate. I made
steady progress, piecing together the moving parts and seeing the broader
structure take shape.

Later in the day, I circled back to the Dummy Hops issue — this time with the
help of my mentor and peers.  
Our discussion opened up several promising ideas, and I’m genuinely excited to
explore them tomorrow.

Sometimes, stepping away is exactly what moves you forward.

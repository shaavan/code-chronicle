# Log 209: Reviewed & Checked

> 11 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finished reviewing the
  [#1240 Recurrence](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240)

## Reflections:

After one last day of concentrated scrutiny, I made it through the final changes
and captured all points of concern.  
Now, only a few sentence- and word-level clean-ups remain before I push the
review.

Eyes open â€” the review's coming.

# Log 203: Synchronous at Last

> 02 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Introduced the
  [synchronous](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3833)
  currency conversion approach.

## Reflections:

After many long hours of work — planning, cleaning, revising, and discussing — I
finally released the synchronous currency conversion approach.

And looking back now, I'm genuinely proud.

What once felt like a complex, tangled problem ended up distilled into something
clean, simple, and elegant. I’ve revisited the commits again and again, and each
time I feel a quiet sense of satisfaction at the clarity and brevity of the
solution.

But none of it would’ve been possible without my mentor. At every step — from
dead ends to breakthroughs — his guidance helped unlock better design choices,
stronger abstractions, and clarity when I couldn't find it on my own. I’m deeply
thankful for that kind of support.

And perhaps more than anything, I’m grateful for this work — for the chance to
build something meaningful, something I enjoy, something that speaks to both my
mind and soul.

A good day. A grateful one.

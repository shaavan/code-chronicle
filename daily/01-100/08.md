# Log 08: "Padding & OffersMessageFlow"

> 01 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Analyzed the optimal value of `P` for padding.
- Made progress on `OffersMessageFlow` by refactoring offer handling from
  `ChannelManager`.

## Reflections:

Between moments of celebration, I carved out some quality time for work today!

First, I focused on
[analyzing](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177#discussion_r1825679358)
the optimal padding value for TLVs, based on how many TLVs a blinded path will
contain.  
Next, I moved forward with the `OffersMessageFlow` implementation, refactoring
offer handling from `ChannelManager` to improve responsibility division.

Looking forward to another productive workday tomorrow!

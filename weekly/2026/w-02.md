# Weekly Log 02: Finishing What Matters

> 08 Jan 2026 – 13 Jan 2026

## Overview

This week was about tightening, refining, and finishing work that had already
crossed the “it works” threshold. The focus shifted from introducing new ideas
to making existing ones **correct, scoped, and review-ready** — especially
around payment dummy hops.

It was a week of careful trade-offs: deciding what to land now, what to defer,
and how to keep progress moving without letting scope sprawl derail momentum.

## Highlights

### Custom TLVs: Review and Cleanup

- Addressed review feedback on **custom TLVs for BOLT11 payments**.
- Cleaned up the implementation based on colleague suggestions, bringing the PR
  closer to merge readiness.
- Continued the post-PR-opening phase of iterating through feedback and
  polishing details.

### Dummy Hops: Privacy and Correctness

- Returned focus to **dummy hops**, addressing concerns around privacy leakage
  via payment relay values.
- Implemented support for **finite payment relay values**, ensuring dummy hops
  are no longer “free” and don’t trivially leak hop distance to the sender.
- Completed parsing logic for finite relay values in dummy hops.

### Scope Discipline and Core Completion

- Explored changes needed in the functional test framework to support non-free
  dummy hops.
- Recognized that test framework updates and public API extensions would
  significantly expand scope.
- Made a deliberate decision to defer those changes to a follow-up PR.
- Finished the remaining core work by implementing **recursive peeling of dummy
  hops** within the public API.

## Reflections

This was a week of sharpening edges rather than building new surfaces.

Several moments reinforced the value of scope discipline: recognizing when a
change is valuable but not _necessary right now_, and choosing to finish the
core feature cleanly before expanding outward. Deferring functional test changes
wasn’t a retreat — it was a way to keep the main line of work moving forward.

Dummy hops are now in a much better state: more realistic, more privacy-aware,
and structurally complete. The remaining work is clearly defined and
well-contained, which is exactly where you want to be at the end of a focused
week.

Overall, this was a satisfying stretch of engineering — the kind where progress
comes from good judgment as much as from code.

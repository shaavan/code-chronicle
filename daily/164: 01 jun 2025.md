# Log 164: Let's Look at It Differently

> 01 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Tried an alternate method to implement the Dummy Hop
  [approach](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/dummy-12)

## Reflections:

On a relaxed weekend, I decided to revisit yesterday’s Dummy Hop puzzle — but
this time, with a different mindset.

Instead of the usual bottom-up method (start with enum definition → handle
parsing complications → integrate with existing logic), I flipped the process. I
took a **top-down approach** over the working branch:

1. First, change `DummyTlv` to an `enum` and see if things still compile.
2. Then, add another variant and check if standard parsing still works.
3. Finally, attempt to parse the special dummy differently — and observe where
   it breaks.

It might seem unstructured on the surface, but this inversion made the pain
points **immediately obvious**. Instead of trying to restructure the entire
framework in one go, I was now solving **concrete friction points**, one at a
time.

The solution isn’t fully integrated yet, but I have high hopes for this
direction. It feels closer, clearer, and more grounded in actual behavior.

Here’s to finishing it up tomorrow — with clarity leading the way.

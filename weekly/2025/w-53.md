# Weekly Log 53: From Questions to Closure

> 23–27 Dec 2025

## Overview

This week marked a shift from open-ended design questions to concrete
resolution. The focus was on consolidating understanding through review, making
pragmatic decisions to unblock progress, and ultimately closing a major
remaining gap in the **payer-side recurrence flow**.

Rather than expanding scope, the work centered on alignment — of assumptions,
data flow, and cryptographic identity — resulting in a clearer and more complete
system.

## Highlights

### Review-Driven Clarity

- Addressed detailed review feedback on the **currency** and **event-model**
  PRs.
- Used the review process to revisit assumptions and re-articulate design
  reasoning.
- Gained a clearer and more grounded understanding of earlier decisions through
  response and revision.

### Payer Flow Progress and Decision-Making

- Returned to the payer recurrence flow after review work.
- Re-examined the unresolved question of maintaining a **consistent signing
  public key** across recurrence sessions.
- Recognized the need to prioritize a working proof of concept over premature
  abstraction.
- Chose a pragmatic approach: storing a `KeyPair` alongside the recurrence
  session data in `ChannelManager`, with assumptions clearly documented.

### Explicit Signing Mechanism Completed

- Implemented explicit signing support for the payer flow.
- Introduced and threaded consistent signing keys across outbound recurrence
  session data, offer payers, recurrence payers, and invoice handling.
- Completed the full explicit signing mechanism, closing a long-standing design
  gap in the recurrence implementation.

## Reflections

This was a week of convergence.

Progress came not from discovering new ideas, but from deciding which questions
needed answering _now_, and which could wait. The willingness to choose momentum
— while documenting assumptions — proved essential in moving the payer flow
toward completion.

Ending the week by finishing the explicit signing mechanism felt especially
satisfying. It brought together several threads that had been evolving
independently and aligned them into a coherent whole.

With this chapter closed, the system feels more complete, and the path forward
clearer. The focus now shifts toward refinement, testing, and preparing the work
for broader review.

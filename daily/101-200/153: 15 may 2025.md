# Log 152: "Here Goes Flo!"

> 15 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finished the last batch of suggestions for `Flow`!

## Reflections:

Okayâ€”just pausing the final grind to document this moment in the chronicles.  
The **Flow PR** is _so_ close to the finish line, I can feel it in my
fingertips.

Today was about knocking out the **last wave of review suggestions**, and
honestly? The
[comments](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#pullrequestreview-2840855941)
so far are looking **super positive**, which makes me feel all the more excited
about what's about to land.

Now, back to catching the final few! Gotta catch 'em all! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

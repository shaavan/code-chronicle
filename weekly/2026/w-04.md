# Weekly Log 04: Threads Old and New

> 21 Jan 2026 – 27 Jan 2026

## Overview

This week was a blend of consolidation and forward-looking work. I focused on
closing in on long-running efforts — especially **payment dummy hops** and
**custom TLVs** — while also stepping back to think more deliberately about
future direction, both for specific designs and for the year ahead.

It was a week of tying threads together, identifying the next layer of work, and
making space for what comes next.

## Highlights

### Payment Dummy Hops: Nearing the Finish Line

- Addressed the final batch of review feedback on **payment dummy hops**
  ([PR][DummyHopsPR]), bringing the implementation close to merge readiness.
- Began work on a focused **follow-up branch** to refine payment relay behavior
  and test coverage ([follow-up work][DummyHopsFollowUp]).
- Introduced **non-trivial dummy TLV values** that can be exercised by LDK’s
  testing framework.
- Spent time investigating a subtle fee discrepancy (on the order of a few
  millisatoshis), choosing to fully understand the behavior rather than
  hand-wave it away.

### Custom TLVs: Quiet Cleanup

- Addressed remaining review suggestions on the **custom TLVs for BOLT11** PR
  ([PR][CustomTLVsPR]).
- Focused on straightforward cleanup and refinement to keep the changes
  reviewable and low-risk.

### Currency & Event-Model: Design-Level Progress

- Continued deeper discussion around **currency conversion** and the
  **event-model** design ([discussion][CurrencyDiscussion]).
- Identified that certain DoS concerns apply to the event-model itself,
  independent of whether currency is coupled or decoupled.
- Used the discussion to clarify assumptions and push the design conversation
  forward constructively.

### Looking Ahead

- Spent time working on the **proposal for the coming year**, grounding it in
  current projects and ongoing design work.
- Watched an initial set of rough ideas evolve into a more coherent narrative,
  outlining possible directions for the months ahead.

## Reflections

This week felt balanced.

There was real progress in finishing and refining existing work — especially
around dummy hops — paired with thoughtful pauses to reconsider design choices
and long-term direction. Some days were about chasing down tiny discrepancies;
others were about stepping back and asking bigger questions.

Taken together, it felt like a week of alignment: cleaning up the past,
stabilizing the present, and sketching the future — all without rushing any one
of them.

A good place to be.

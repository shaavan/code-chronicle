# Log 89: "And the Journey Continues"

> 12 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated
  [RouteParametersConfig](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3342.09).
- Worked on updating
  [Custom Data](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830):
  [branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/custom_tlvs-14).

## Reflections:

Today, I focused on addressing the latest suggestions for the
**RouteParametersConfig** branch. Everything went as expected, and I was able to
handle the updates fairly quickly.

After that, I shifted my focus to refining the **Custom Data PR**, incorporating
the latest feedback. Matt pointed out that custom data is only necessary when
the **onion is inbound and received over a blinded path**. To address this, I
removed its unnecessary usage from the codebaseâ€”simplifying things
significantly.

That part is done! Now, the only step left is to **update the test**, which Iâ€™ll
tackle tomorrow. ðŸš€

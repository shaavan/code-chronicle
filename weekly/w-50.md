# Week 50: "Momentum in Motion"

> Week of 9th Dec 2024 - 14th Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

This week was a mix of focused problem-solving, technical improvements, and
steady progress across various branches. Here’s a summary of the key
achievements:

- **PR Reviews**: Continued reviewing PRs to strengthen my reviewing skills and
  contribute to the broader workflow. Notably, I reviewed PRs like
  [#3435](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3435) and
  [#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378), which
  directly impact my own work.

- **Finalizing `OffersMessageFlow`**: Made significant updates to the branch,
  simplifying the `OffersMessageCommons` trait and addressing key dependencies.
  This work laid the groundwork for further changes in related PRs.

- **Implementing the Router-Based Approach**: Successfully implemented the new
  "router-based" approach for
  [#3246](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246), which
  introduces the ability to create offers and refunds without a blinded path.
  This was a challenging task, requiring focus, problem-solving, and refinement,
  but it was immensely satisfying to complete.

- **Padding Analysis Update**: Updated the analysis for the
  [`Padding`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177)
  branch to reflect changes in `ReceiveTlvs` sizes after the merge of the
  [`Payment TLVs Authentication`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3435)
  branch. The updates bring the `Padding` branch closer to readiness for
  merging.

## Reflections:

This week was a balance of high-paced challenges and quieter moments of
analysis. Finalizing the `OffersMessageFlow` updates and successfully
implementing the router-based approach for
[#3246](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246) were
standout achievements, showcasing the power of focus and iteration.

On the other hand, updating the `Padding` branch analysis during a slower
weekend provided space for contemplation and planning. The merge of key
dependencies and continued reviews also emphasized the collaborative nature of
the work, highlighting how interconnected progress can be.

As I wrap up this week, I feel a deep sense of accomplishment and look forward
to carrying this momentum into the coming days. Here’s to more challenges,
insights, and victories ahead!

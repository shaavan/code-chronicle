## What I Worked On

- Worked on preparing the Q7 report

## Reflections

On this slow and quiet weekend, I decided it was time to look back at the past
quarter — and what a packed and rewarding one it was.

From steady progress on **payment dummy hops** to introducing both the **payee
and payer flow drafts for recurrence**, it’s been a long journey. Challenging at
times, but never demoralizing. Demanding, but consistently fulfilling.

Throughout it all, I’ve had the support of wonderful peers and mentors, and that
made all the difference.

It’s always a humbling moment to pause and see how far you’ve come from where
you began.

Grateful.

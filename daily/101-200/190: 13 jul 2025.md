# Log 190: _Synchronicity_

> 13 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Worked on the synchronous trait-based approach for the Flow's event model

## Reflections:

Today was a day of choosing a direction and going all-in with it.

The asynchronous event model I had been working on was falling into a core issue
— the very asynchronicity that made it flexible was also making it messy.
Generating events with all possible branches preloaded sounded powerful at
first, but it ended up overwhelming the user with too many paths and too little
clarity.

That’s when a simpler design revealed itself. What if we just asked the user to
implement a single trait — a `convert_fiat_to_btc` function — and we handle the
rest? A synchronous, compile-time trait that quietly takes care of the
complexity, while letting the user stay in control of the logic. And if they
don’t want to, we provide a default implementation that simply fails, just like
today’s LDK behavior.

This felt clean. It felt aligned. So today I focused on implementing the first
pieces of it.

A good push forward on a good weekend. ✨

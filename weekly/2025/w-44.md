# Weekly Log 44: Stepping Away to See Clearly

> 25 – 28 October 2025

## Overview

This week was all about contrast — exploration, exhaustion, and eventual
renewal.  
After a long stretch of technical deep-dives, I began with something new and
open-ended: exploring **LDK Node**. From there, I returned to the dense maze of
**Dummy Payment Hops**, navigating through layers of debugging, insight, and
(occasionally) frustration.  
By the week’s end, I chose to step back, redirecting focus to the **Recurrence
Flow**, and in that change of pace found both clarity and momentum.

## Highlights

- **Explored** the structure and design of **LDK Node**, guided by
  [this excellent OSS project exploration guide](https://pncnmnp.github.io/blogs/oss-guide.html).
- **Made major progress** debugging test issues in **Dummy Payment Hops**,
  uncovering hidden logic gaps like unintended fee creation via
  `blinded_payinfo`.
- **Endured and analyzed** new failures in the Dummy Hop tests — a reminder of
  how one solved problem can surface ten new ones.
- **Re-centered focus** on the **Recurrence Flow**, mapping its components and
  reestablishing design direction after a loop of intense debugging.
- **Collaborated with mentor and peers**, generating fresh ideas to simplify the
  Dummy Hop logic for the next iteration.

## Reflections

This was a week of learning how _stepping away_ can sometimes be the most
productive move of all.  
The deep debugging sessions were challenging — the kind that test both patience
and perspective — but they also made the later shift back to recurrence work
feel almost meditative in comparison.

There’s something rewarding in alternating between chaos and clarity, between
diving in and stepping back.  
Progress, it turns out, isn’t always about pushing harder — sometimes, it’s
about letting things breathe until the next insight surfaces.

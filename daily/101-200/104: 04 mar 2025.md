# Log 104: "And That's Done!"

> 04 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Opened the PR for the **alternative Flow approach**.  
  [PR #3639](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639).

## Reflections:

Today was a **long, focused workday**, dedicated to one singular goalâ€”**getting
the Flow prepared and submitted.**

There were a few **roadblocks**, particularly in integrating the new **Flow
parameter within ChannelManager**, but I worked through them all and finally got
the approach **ready and out there!**

I also had a **productive discussion with my mentor**, where we identified **new
points of improvement and optimizations** to make Flow even more **efficient and
useful**.

Tomorrowâ€™s plan? **Bringing those improvements to life!** ðŸŒŸ

# Log 224: Two Frontiers

> 02 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] with PoC implementation of [recurrence].
- Continued outlining approach for dummy hops in payment paths.

## Reflections

More progress today on the recurrence implementation. The first goal was to
bring all recurrence-specific fields into play, wiring them into the system.

Doing so clarified a lot—and raised some key questions. The biggest: should a
recurring invoice request be defined as a separate struct, distinct from the
standard one? It’s a subtle but important decision, with structural trade-offs
that I’m currently laying out and evaluating.

Later, I took a short break from recurrence work and turned my attention to
dummy hops. With the [recent PR] introducing dummy hops for blinded **message** paths
now merged, the next objective is supporting dummy hops for **payment** paths.

The path forward is active on both fronts—and the coming days will be all about
shaping these two journeys in parallel.

# Log 54: "Closing Curtains on Padding"

> 25 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Re-attempted solving
  [#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320).
- Updated padding analysis, fixed values, and finalized the
  [PR](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3177.28).

## Reflections:

After spending a couple more hours wrestling with
[#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320), I
decided to shift gears and focus on better utilizing my time. I turned my
attention to the
[`Padding`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177) branch.

Following Monday's discussion with my mentor, I finalized the padding values
weâ€™ll use and spent the day wrapping up the branch. This included expanding the
PR to introduce separate padding for Payment TLVs when the blinded path belongs
to an Offer or a Refund. I also added a new test specifically for the updated
padding logic.

It felt incredibly rewarding to put the finishing touches on one of my older
PRs, especially on the auspicious day of Christmas! A productive and fulfilling
holiday well spent.

Wishing everyone a warm Christmas and a beautiful New Year ahead!

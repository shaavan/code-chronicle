# Log 50: "Two Birds, One Stone"

> 20 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated the
  [approach](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-8) to
  handle currency support for Offers.

## Reflections:

Today, I discussed the updated approach for asynchronous BOLT12 message handling
with my mentor. The discussion provided clarity on how to properly implement it
and revealed how this change could also enable currency support for Offers in
the LDK codebase. Thatâ€™s a winâ€”solving two problems with one solution!

On another note, this log marks a special milestone: 50 logs! Iâ€™m so happy to
have stuck with this processâ€”itâ€™s been incredibly rewarding and motivating.

Hereâ€™s to many more logs and continued progress ahead! ðŸŽ‰

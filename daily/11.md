# Log 11: "TLV Distinction by Source"

> 06 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Introduced custom TLV distinctions based on source in
  [#2830](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830).

## Reflections:

During our discussion on custom TLVs, we realized that there could be two
distinct sources for custom TLVs within a received Onion message. One originates
from what the sender provides, while the other comes from `custom_tlvs` in the
reply path that we add for our own purposes.

Todayâ€™s work focused on introducing this new abstraction into the codebase and
figuring out the technical nuances required to support an additional TLV source
while preserving current functionality.

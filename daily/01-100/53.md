# Log 53: "The Brick Wall"

## Reflections:

Today felt like ramming my head against a brick wall. The wall didn’t move, but
my head definitely started hurting.

What I initially thought was a simple fix turned out to be far more complicated.
The issue involves completing a payment in the test, where the HTLCs are already
locked. The catch? Once the HTLC is locked, the channels are closed due to the
setup. However, opening a new channel requires no pending transactions. This
creates a sort of “deadlock”—how can I complete the transaction without a
channel, and how can I open a new channel with pending transactions?

It’s frustrating, to say the least. But I know once the solution clicks, it will
feel so obvious that it’ll almost be funny. I’m just hoping that “eureka” moment
comes soon.

This struggle also makes me reflect—could we ever find simple solutions without
the struggle? Isn’t the simplicity of a solution often a testament to the effort
it took to discover it? Maybe. It’s something to ponder while I go back to
ramming my head against this brick wall!

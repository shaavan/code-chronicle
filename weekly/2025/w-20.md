# Week 20: "Through Eyes of Others, We Sharpen Our Own"

> Week of 08 May 2025 ‚Äì 13 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **Flow Finalization**

  - Addressed a rich set of
    [Flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639)
    suggestions, particularly from the **async payments** perspective.
  - Refactored Flow to remove internal dependencies on `Router` and
    `EntropySource`, making the system cleaner and more modular.
  - Investigated and resolved
    [an obscure test failure](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#discussion_r2075827495)
    caused by shared timestamp logic‚Äîdebugged collaboratively with mentor and
    peers.
  - Finalized CI fixes and polished the code with proper documentation and
    parameter handling.

- **Dummy TLVs PR
  ([#3726](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726))**
  - Incorporated multiple rounds of thoughtful peer feedback.
  - Engaged in deep design reasoning‚Äîdefending some choices, accepting others,
    and walking away with greater clarity about the internal mechanics and their
    intended behavior.

## Reflections:

This week was a testament to the power of **collaborative clarity**.

Every suggestion, every piece of feedback‚Äîespecially from those seeing the code
with fresh eyes‚Äîbecame a mirror for refining my own perspective. In Flow, I saw
what needed to be untangled. In Dummy TLVs, I discovered the depth of design
intuition and the importance of defending decisions _with understanding_, not
attachment.

One of the highlights was resolving a **mysterious Flow test failure**, tracing
it all the way to a timestamp update mismatch‚Äîsomething subtle, but deeply
satisfying to resolve.

By the end of the week, Flow is clean, CI is green, and Dummy TLVs are sharper
in concept than ever before.

Here‚Äôs to shared vision, respectful disagreements, and growing sharper‚Äîtogether.

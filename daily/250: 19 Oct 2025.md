# Log 250: The Next Steps

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] further on the payment dummy hops implementation.

## Reflections

With the parsing mechanism now in place, today’s focus was integrating it into
the **Default Router** implementation.  
It turned out to be less straightforward than expected — which, to be fair, I
had already anticipated given the complexity of the overall project.

Most of the tests passed cleanly, but a few failed in surprising ways.  
For instance, claiming payments worked perfectly for _announced_ channels, but
failed for _unannounced_ ones — along with two more odd, distinct edge cases.

It was fascinating to watch the code break in ways I hadn’t predicted. That’s
the real joy of this process: seeing how systems behave when they’re pushed
beyond expectation.

Tomorrow will be even more interesting — the day of solutions.

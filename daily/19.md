# Log 19: "Structuring a Megalith"

> 14 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Structured the `OffersMessageFlow` code and worked on further refinements to
  better atomize the code.

## Reflections:

`OffersMessageFlow`—even after completion—remains a beast to tackle. The new
challenge is “atomization”: how can I make the code atomic when all the
functions, structures, and tests are so interconnected?

Tackling this question led to some interesting solutions, and I experimented
with one of them today. If my idea works, I’ll be able to open the branch
tomorrow—and there will definitely be some celebration if that happens! :)

# Weekly Log 38: Threads Aligned

> 10 – 17 September 2025

## Overview

This week was about reconnection and alignment—across systems, across PRs, and
even with myself.

Coming off a flu-induced break, I returned with a fresh focus on refining the
recurring payments flow. That meant cleaning up rushed logic, improving error
handling, and untangling the match gymnastics left behind in the initial
implementation sprint.

Parallel to that, I rebased the recurrence branch over the updated currency PR,
ensuring that the two major flows—currency handling and recurrence—could evolve
cleanly together. The rebase brought a new layer of clarity to the architecture,
and set the stage for future integration work.

The rest of the week was spent addressing final review feedback on both [#3964]
(invoice request check) and the [currency] PR. Bit by bit, threads are being
pulled tight—and everything is starting to align.

## Highlights

- Refined the full flow for accepting recurring payments:

  - Improved error handling, serialization, and control flow.
  - Documented reasoning behind past decisions for easier refactoring.

- Rebasing the [recurrence] branch onto the latest [currency] PR:

  - Resolved conflicts, ensured correctness, and prepared the flow for future
    work.

- Addressed final review feedback on:
  - [#3964] – invoice request response improvements.
  - [currency] PR – groundwork for multi-currency support.

## Reflections

This wasn’t a flashy week—but it was foundational.

So much of the work was quiet, precise, and careful—refining under-the-hood
logic and aligning parallel efforts. I didn’t write a thousand lines of new
code. I made sure that when I _do_, it’s landing on solid ground.

## What I Worked On

- [Addressed] the final batch of suggestions for payment dummy hops

## Reflections

Today, getting back into my work, I focused on addressing the [final batch of
review suggestions][suggestions] before merge.

It’s genuinely satisfying to see the shape that **payment dummy hops** has
finally taken. After multiple rounds of iteration, refinement, and careful
design choices, the feature feels solid and ready. I’m very much looking forward
to seeing it merged.

With that nearing completion, my focus now shifts to what comes next: building
the follow-up work to refine the testing framework and, ultimately, exposing
dummy hops cleanly through the public API.

Let’s go.

# Week 04: "Momentum & Milestones"

> Week of 20 Jan 2025 – 23 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was all about maintaining momentum, refining ongoing projects, and
celebrating key milestones. Here’s a summary of the week’s achievements:

- **Updating PRs**: Focused on cleaning up and updating the
  [`Padding`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3177.29) and
  [`i3381a`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3504.04)
  branches, addressing suggestions, and preparing them for merging into the
  codebase.

- **Q3 Progress Report**: Compiled and submitted the Q3 progress report to the
  OpenSats team, reflecting on the past quarter’s work and summarizing key
  contributions.

- **Refining `OffersMessageFlow`**: Addressed feedback and worked on improving
  the commit history for
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/omf-25),
  preserving git blame, and ensuring a clean, traceable structure for the
  branch.

- **Final Updates**: Cleaned up the `OffersMessageFlow` branch, resolved CI
  issues, and made documentation updates to prepare the PR for submission.

## Reflections:

This week emphasized the importance of persistence and attention to detail.
Revisiting and refining older branches, like `Padding` and `OffersMessageFlow`,
underscored how small improvements can have a big impact on clarity and
usability.

Compiling the Q3 progress report was an opportunity to step back and reflect on
the broader scope of work, transforming initial nerves into pride for the
progress made.

It was a week of ticking off significant milestones and laying the groundwork
for future progress. Feeling grateful for the productive flow and excited for
what’s to come!

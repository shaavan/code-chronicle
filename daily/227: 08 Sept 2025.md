# Log 227: Pilgrim to the Edge

> 08 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Implemented] the complete flow for accepting recurring payments.

## Reflections

After days of groundwork, today felt like a pilgrimage—the moment where ideas
finally transformed into working code.

But I wanted more than just steady progress. So I challenged myself:  
What if I didn’t just do what I _usually_ accomplish in a day?  
What if I aimed for what I normally achieve in a week?

And so I did. I pushed through the entire flow for accepting recurring
payments—from defining new fields, to parsing logic, to compile-time guarantees,
and finally, actual payment acceptance. It was intense. Messy. Energizing.

And it left me with a beautiful, dangerous question:  
**If I can do _this_, what then is my real potential? My real edge?**

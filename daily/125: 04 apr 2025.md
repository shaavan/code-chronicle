## Reflections:

Today was a **quite & meaningful** day. I focused on addressing suggestions on
two of my ongoing PRs and spent intentional time reviewing and prioritizing my
workload for the upcoming days.

Interestingly, what stood out was a subtle but valuable realizationâ€”I found
myself avoiding certain parts of my work, not because they were inherently
difficult, but because they had **accumulated a mental weight** over time. The
longer I left them untouched, the heavier they began to feel.

But once I finally sat down and looked them in the eye, I realized they werenâ€™t
daunting at all. It reminded me of the feeling we get before reaching out to an
old friend after a long pauseâ€”thereâ€™s a little awkwardness in the anticipation,
but once the conversation begins, it dissolves almost immediately. Thatâ€™s
exactly how it felt today.

A **self-reflective, grounding day**â€”and a gentle reminder that facing small
things with presence is often all it takes to move forward with ease. ðŸŒ±

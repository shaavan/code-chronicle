# Log 276: Drawing a Line, Then a Longer One, Then a Longer One...

> 27 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Updated] payment dummy hops

## Reflections

After finally opening the [recurrence draft][RecurrencePR] yesterday, I returned
to the world of payment dummy hops. There were quite a few reviewer suggestions
waiting for me — so today was about going through them one by one.

It’s interesting, isn’t it? You push a branch thinking it’s pristine, polished,
and done. Then someone points out a small refinement, and you think: _"How did I
not see that?"_ You make the change, and somehow, the work becomes even more
pristine than it was before. More “complete” than your original idea of
complete.

And so the cycle continues. You draw a line. Then a longer one. You say,
_"Nothing can be longer than this line."_ Until you draw another.

It’s humbling. It’s beautiful.

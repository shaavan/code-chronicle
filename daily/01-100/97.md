# Log 97: "BOLT11 Payments Simplified!"

> 24 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Opened a new PR
  ([#3617](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3617))
  simplifying the BOLT11 payment flow.

## Reflections:

Building on the foundation of
[`RouteParametersConfig`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342),
I was finally able to implement a **BOLT12-like payment flow for BOLT11
payments.**

The core idea was straightforwardâ€”**consolidate the configuration** of per-route
parameters and payment parameters (those shared across retries on multiple
routes) **within `ChannelManager` itself,** while still **preserving user
flexibility** to configure specific parameters via `RouteParametersConfig`.

Iâ€™m proud to see this come togetherâ€”it felt like connecting the last missing
piece of a puzzle. What a wonderful day of building and refining! ðŸš€

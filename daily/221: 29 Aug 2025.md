# Log 221: The Journey to Metamorphosis

## What I Worked On

- Began PoC implementation for [recurrence] logic.

## Reflections

Today, I felt like a beginner all over again.

There was no guide, no reference code to lean on—just the question: can I build
something entirely new, from scratch, and still make it fit within the broader
system?

That’s what implementing recurrence demands. It introduces several novel ideas:
automatic triggering of invoice requests by the payer, storing timestamps of
previous payments, handling recurrence base fields, paywindows, and tracking the
`period_index`. And every one of those needs to be integrated in a way that’s
cohesive with the rest of the codebase—no bolted-on hacks, no awkward
scaffolding.

There’s no blueprint here—this is one of those foundational journeys you take
alone. But that’s also what makes it meaningful.

With guidance from others, trust in my discipline, and belief in the process,
I’m hopeful about where this path will lead.

# Log 87: "On Rebase"

> 10 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Progressed rebasing
  [`RouteParamsConfig`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342).

## Reflections:

Rebasing is an inevitable part of engineering developmentâ€”but what happens when
youâ€™re rebasing **old** code onto a **completely changed** codebase? You start
realizing that the way things used to work **no longer applies**. Then, just as
you think you're making progress, you hit an unfamiliar error **from a part of
the codebase you've never even touched before**.

That feeling? **Aporia.** A perfect word to sum up today.

But tomorrow, the sun will rise again. And tomorrow, there will be another
journey through the abyss. **May it be brighter than today.**

But for now, we rest. ðŸŒ™

# Log 253: Layer by Layer

> 26 Oct 2025

## What I Worked On

- Made significant [progress] on solving test issues in the **Payment Path Dummy
  Hops** implementation.

## Reflections

Today was a day of experimentation — not just with code, but with _how_ I
approach it.  
Being a Sunday, I decided to take a different path: instead of hacking through
the code and chasing the “line of error,” I simply read the logs.

Line by line.  
Patiently.

At first, it felt slow — long and winding — but soon, it started to yield
results.  
Take the case of the unexpected fee cost with the blinded path that includes an
unannounced introduction node. Initially, I assumed it was a shortcoming in the
test setup. But as I followed the logs, the truth unfolded: it was an
implementation gap.

Not a missed fee calculation, but an _extra_ one — a faulty `blinded_payinfo`
causing us to create a fee expense right at the path creation stage.

It felt thrilling to peel the problem layer by layer and finally glimpse its
core.  
I’m excited to continue this investigation tomorrow.

Onwards.

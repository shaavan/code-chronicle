# Log 289: The Question of Identity

> 15 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on introducing an explicit key-based invoice request builder for
  the payer flow

## Reflections

After addressing the major actions and comments on other PRs, I returned to the
**payer flow** today — and quickly noticed a missing piece.

While introducing recurrence payers earlier, I hadn’t fully accounted for one
crucial requirement:  
**successive invoice requests must be signed with the same payer signing public
key**.

Today’s focus was on introducing support for that. However, it immediately
surfaced a deeper and more interesting problem. A static payer signing public
key implies a corresponding static private key — which, in turn, must be
remembered _somewhere_.

And that’s where things get tricky.

Persisting a signing key introduces questions around key management, security
boundaries, and how to do this safely without compromising payer key material.
This is the challenge I spent time thinking through today.

The quest is still ongoing. Tomorrow, I’ll discuss this design space with
colleagues and senior reviewers to find a secure and appropriate approach.

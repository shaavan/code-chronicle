# Log 299: Cleaning the House

## What I Worked On

- Triaged an older set of low-priority issues

## Reflections

First off — happy new year!

After wrapping up my break, I eased back into momentum with a deliberately
low-pressure task: **cleanup**.

Earlier last year, I had picked up a set of low-priority issues to work on
during free time — partly to contribute, and partly to learn more about
different parts of LDK. Over time, I managed to resolve several of them. But as
the remaining ones lingered, it became clear that they were increasingly
low-impact: shifting from _nice-to-have_ to _okay-to-have_.

At the same time, progress on those issues became disproportionately hard. What
might be a 30-minute fix for someone deeply familiar with that part of the
codebase was taking me far longer, with diminishing returns.

So today, I made the call to go through the remaining issues and triage them
properly.

It feels good to clean house. An empty cup is easier to fill, and I’m excited to
fill this one with new learnings and meaningful progress in the year ahead.

## What I Worked On:

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3504)
  addressing
  [#3381](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3381).

## Reflections:

Today, I tackled a new issue that was recently assigned to me. The focus of the
issue was to improve test utilities by ensuring there are no dangling RAA
blockers at the end of tests.

While the task initially felt intimidating, taking the time to thoroughly
understand the problem and experiment with solutions made it manageable. I’m
really happy that I was able to produce something tangible in just a day of
working through the issue.

It’s been a productive and satisfying day—an interesting start to the weekend!

# Log 194: _Revisiting the Past_

> 19 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated the Dummy Hop branch to align with the now-merged  
  [`#3917`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3917)
- Began drafting the Q2 quarterly report

## Reflections:

Today was a day of re-alignment — in code, and in spirit.

With `#3917` now merged and the new `ReceiveAuthKey` system officially part of
the codebase, I returned to the Dummy Hop branch. Much of what was once complex
could now be simplified. The authentication logic no longer needed workarounds —
just alignment with the foundation we’d already laid. So I reworked the branch,
stripping the outdated layers and letting the new structure breathe.

Once that was done, I turned inward — to the quarter gone by.  
Drafting the quarterly report always feels like a quiet ritual. There’s a pause
before you begin, a subtle tension in the question: _Did I do what I set out to
do?_ It’s both a reckoning and a recognition.

After reviewing the first half of my work, I felt grounded.  
Some things went to plan, some didn’t — and some unfolded more deeply than I’d
imagined.

Tomorrow, on a weekend meant for stillness, I’ll shape these fragments into
something whole.

A moment worth returning to.

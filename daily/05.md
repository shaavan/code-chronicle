# Log 05: "On Conjuring OffersMessageFlow"

> 28 Oct 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Brainstormed a viable approach to introduce `OffersMessageFlow`, creating a
  new method for synchronous and asynchronous Bolt12 message handling.

## Reflections:

I spent today digging through the code, figuring out everything I’ll need to
refactor to bring `OffersMessageFlow` to life. I’d say the time was
well-spent—I’ve managed to outline a solid approach, with just a few kinks left
to iron out. Hopefully, they’ll smooth out tomorrow. Here’s to ironing! 👕🍻

# Log 114: "Let's Get the Presentation Going"

> 19 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **Addressed feedback** from yesterday's meeting.
- **Completed & got approval** for
  [#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658).
- **Posted insights** on
  [Mattâ€™s issue discussion](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3669#issuecomment-2736461940).
- **Clarified design choices** in the
  [Flow refactor](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#discussion_r2003163370).
- **Started preparing my presentation** for the upcoming **Bitcoin Summit**.

## Reflections:

Today was a **well-rounded and productive day**. I tackled several layers of
workâ€”**closing open PRs, refining ongoing discussions, and preparing for the
Summit.**

First, I **wrapped up and got approval** for PR #3658, which was satisfying to
see through to completion. Then, I continued the discussion on the **blinded
path issue** Matt raised, summarizing our insights to help steer the next steps.

On the **Flow branch**, I spent time addressing review feedbackâ€”not just
implementing fixes, but also providing **clear explanations** on why certain
refactors were made, ensuring alignment with reviewers.

Finally, I shifted gears to **presentation mode**â€”structuring my thoughts and
slides for the upcoming Bitcoin Summit. Itâ€™s coming together well, and Iâ€™m
excited to refine it further in the coming days.

A day **well spent**, balancing engineering, discussion, and preparation! ðŸš€

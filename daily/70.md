# Log 70: "Final Cleanup"

> 16 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed CI fixups for the
  [`custom_tlvs`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/custom_tlvs-12)
  branch.

## Reflections:

Still on the path to recovery, I spent today refining and cleaning up the
`custom_tlvs` implementation. Most of the effort went into fixing CI issues to
prepare the branch for its pull request.

The work is nearly complete, and if time (and health) permits, I might wrap it
up later today. Fingers crossed! ðŸ¤žâœ¨

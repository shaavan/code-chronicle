# Week 11: "Chapters Closed, New Paths Opened"

> Week of 06 March 2025 â€“ 13 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was a balanced arc of closure and new beginnings. Hereâ€™s an overview
of key accomplishments:

- âœ… **Closed Chapters:**

  - Finalized and wrapped up two long-standing PRs:
    - [Padding PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177)
    - [BOLT11 Payment Flow PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3617)
  - It felt fulfilling to see these efforts culminate and merge into the
    codebase.

- ðŸš€ **New Work Initiated:**

  - Opened a new PR for
    [PaymentClaimable improvements](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655),
    enhancing support for MPP by listing all last-hop channel IDs instead of
    just one.
  - Introduced another PR to resolve event duplication:
    [Fixing InvoiceReceived event behavior](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658).

- ðŸ”„ **Refinements & Review Cycles:**

  - Actively responded to feedback, updated both new PRs multiple times, and
    ensured CI and implementation stayed clean and robust.
  - Thoughtfully reworked internal design decisions based on suggestionsâ€”for
    instance, switching from `Vec<Option<ChannelId>>` to a cleaner
    `Vec<ChannelId>` interface in `#3655`, and restructuring event handling
    logic in `#3658`.

- ðŸ§  **Rethinking Flow Architecture:**
  - Spent substantial time brainstorming and iterating on the
    [alternate Flow design](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639).
  - Discussed trade-offs between different Flow abstractions and started
    implementing a revised architecture where **blinded path creation is passed
    as a closure**, decoupling `OffersMessageFlow` from `MessageRouter`
    responsibilities.
  - This new direction enhances modularity and flexibilityâ€”paving the way for
    cleaner public APIs and better separation of concerns.

## Reflections:

This week had a graceful rhythmâ€”**closing long arcs, shipping new improvements,
and laying the groundwork for deeper architectural refinements.**

There was a genuine sense of **evolution in thought and implementation**,
especially around Flow design. Collaborative discussions with my mentor played a
crucial role in shaping clarity and direction. Also, the act of proactively
preventing future review blockers, refining internal logic, and finding better
design patterns felt deeply satisfying.

From polishing past efforts to exploring new horizons, the journey
continuesâ€”steadily, thoughtfully, and with a quiet confidence in the craft. âœ¨

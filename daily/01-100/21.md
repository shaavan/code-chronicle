# Log 21: "Writing Documentation"

> 16 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Completed the `OffersMessageFlow` branch and began writing documentation.

## Reflections:

Finally, the `OffersMessageFlow`
[branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/91f5ee33923833b009683760916fa0a0112fd2be)
is finished! Now, for the final step: writing clear and comprehensive
documentation to wrap it all up.

Iâ€™ll try to make some progress on it this weekend. Happy weekend to everyone!

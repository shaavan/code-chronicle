# Log 75: "Finished, Prepared, Served"

> 23 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3412.12) the
  `OffersMessageFlow` PR.
- Finalized and submitted the Q3 Progress Report to the OpenSats team.

## Reflections:

Today was a productive day of wrapping things up and tying loose ends. After
addressing yesterdayâ€™s suggestions, I cleaned up the `OffersMessageFlow` branch,
ensuring the CI and documentation were in order before pushing the update.

I also finalized my Q3 progress report and submitted it to the OpenSats team. It
feels great to complete these significant tasks and reflect on the progress
made. Proud of what I accomplished today! ðŸš€

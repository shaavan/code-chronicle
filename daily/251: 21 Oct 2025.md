# Log 251: The Three Horsemen

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] further on the payment dummy hops implementation.

## Reflections

Today was an interesting day. After finally getting the base functionality
stable and integrating dummy hops into the Default Router, I ran into three…
_very_ interesting problems.

Three untouched, independent tests — all failing for completely different
reasons.

The first? It didn’t have the fee it expected.  
The second? It panicked because the event it was waiting for never arrived.  
And the third — my personal favorite — an expected **failed HTLC** unexpectedly
behaving as **malformed** HTLC.

So began the day’s quest: tracking down each of these rogue behaviors and
uncovering the reasons behind their rebellion. The debugging isn’t done yet, but
I’ve mapped the battlefield — and tomorrow, I ride back into the storm.

Here’s to taming the Three Horsemen of Chaos.

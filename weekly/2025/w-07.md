# Week 07: "Structure, Flow & Persistence"

> Week of 08 Feb 2025 â€“ 15 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was a deep dive into **restructuring, refining, and preparing key PRs
for review**, with a strong focus on **Flow, RouteParamsConfig, and Custom
Data**. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the major accomplishments:

- **Restructuring Flow**: I spent significant time cleaning up and restructuring
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/omf-32),
  making sure the commit history was **concise, coherent, and structured** for
  better readability and maintainability.

- **Fixing CI for Flow**: After restructuring, I tackled CI issues and ensured
  Flow was in a **stable, mergeable state**. Debugging CI is always a long
  process, but it was worth the effort.

- **Finalizing Flow Rebase**: With CI fixed and the structure refined, I
  **completed the rebase** of Flow, ensuring it's **clean and review-ready**.
  [Final commit](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3412.16).

- **Updating RouteParamsConfig**: I worked on bringing
  [`RouteParamsConfig`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3342.09)
  **up to date**, addressing suggestions and refining its structure to align
  better with the latest LDK changes.

- **Refining Custom Data Handling**: I revisited
  [`Custom Data`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830),
  working on **removing unnecessary code** while improving its usability. One
  key update was ensuring that **custom data is only needed for blinded
  receives**, reducing unnecessary complexity.

## Reflections:

This week was a test of **focus, patience, and structured thinking**â€”untangling
Flowâ€™s structure, handling rebases, and refining existing PRs required both
**deep work and careful planning**.

Thereâ€™s something truly satisfying about seeing a **complex system fall into
place**â€”what started as fragmented updates across multiple PRs is now cleaner,
more maintainable, and **ready for review**.

With Flow, RouteParamsConfig, and Custom Data all in a **stronger position**,
Iâ€™m **excited for next weekâ€™s reviews and progress**. But for nowâ€”a well-earned
**weekend of rest!** ðŸš€

# Weekly Log 22: From Refinement to Reach

> Week of 20 May – 27 May 2025

## Highlights:

- Finalized updates and polish on the long-running `Flow` PR.
- Refined the Currency event model and completed its generalized event
  structure.
- Discussed core architectural decisions with mentor around event design and
  extensibility.
- Revisited PR
  [#3514](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3514) — still
  unresolved but revealed deeper nuances in channel closure behavior.
- Merged thought with action — balancing cleanups, conversations, and core logic
  changes.

## Reflections:

This week marked the conclusion of one of the longest arcs in my LDK journey so
far: the **Flow** PR. After weeks of refinement, I addressed the final review
suggestions, cleaned up lingering CI failures, and even added a few small
quality-of-life improvements. A quiet kind of perfectionism kicked in — the kind
that feels right when something big is about to land.

From there, my attention shifted to Flow’s next chapter: **Currency support and
event generalization**. With my mentor’s guidance, I clarified a subtle but
important distinction — instead of generating narrowly-scoped events, we could
emit **generalized, richly informative events**, and let user-defined triggers
shape how they’re handled. That shift simplified the model and opened new
possibilities. By midweek, I had the new event structure up and running.

Toward the end of the week, I circled back to PR #3514 — a tough one I’ve
wrestled with before. It involves simulating a stale `ChannelManager` and still
ensuring HTLC claims go through on-chain. Despite simulating the chain activity
correctly, the payment fails, and I’m still unsure why. It’s the kind of
roadblock where a fresh pair of experienced eyes could really help.

All in all, this was a week of **resolution, architecture, and unanswered
puzzles**. One PR nears its end, another prepares to bloom, and one test remains
unresolved — but every thread is alive and moving forward.

Onward.

# Log 32: "Flow & The Mega Diff"

> 29 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Expanded and updated `OffersMessageFlow`, addressing all remaining
  suggestions.

## Reflections:

Today, I sat down to work with a single intention: “I won’t get up until it’s
done.” It was a tough commitment because there was still so much to address. But
I decided—and I stayed.

To my surprise, keeping that decision led me into a flow-like state. Time just
disappeared, and I got everything done. Once I updated the branch, I decided to
check the difference between the two versions and was
[shocked](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/compare/pr3412.02..pr3412.03).
The difference itself is larger than many of my PRs combined.

I’m so proud of what I accomplished today. But even more, I’m fascinated by the
power of the human mind. When we truly set our minds to something, what can’t we
achieve?

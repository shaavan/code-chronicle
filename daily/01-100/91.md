# Log 91: "Fixing the CI"

> 14 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Fixed [`Flow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/omf-35) CI.

## Reflections:

Today was all about **fixing CI** for the `Flow` restructuring I worked on
yesterday.

CI fixes always take _way_ longer than expectedâ€”waiting, debugging, rerunning,
repeat. But I stuck through the process and finally got it done!

Now, onto the **rebase!** ðŸš€

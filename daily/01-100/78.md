# Log 78: "Reviewing the Layers"

> 28 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Reviewed](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378#discussion_r1932639839)
  the TLV mapping support PR.

## Reflections:

Today, I delved into reviewing one of the older proc macro PRs. It was a
fascinating dive into the intricate and somewhat alien world of macros.

After a detailed review, everything initially seemed on point, which was
reassuring, especially since one of my PRs builds upon this work. However, I
noticed a potentially significant design quirk: to maintain backward
compatibility, "new_fields" would need to incorporate data from "old_fields."
But if old fields are public and the new ones are private, someone could modify
the old field, inadvertently changing the data in the private new fieldâ€”breaking
the expected encapsulation.

I raised this concern in my review, as I felt it was a critical point to
address. It felt good to thoroughly and diligently examine the PR and contribute
meaningful feedback.

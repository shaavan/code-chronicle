# Log 81: "Exploring Beyond"

> 01 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Reviewed [#3581](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3581).

## Reflections:

Today, I stepped out of my usual comfort zone and explored other PRs to
contribute through reviews. While searching, I landed on
[#3581](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3581), which aims
to improve the **faster RGS (Rapid Gossip Sync) application**.

In short, RGS allows sharing the entire relevant channel gossip as a snapshot,
enabling new nodes to sync the channel graph efficiently. This PR proposed an
optimizationâ€”RGS application doesnâ€™t strictly require verifying every public key
involved. By skipping this check and instead using `NodeId` along with a fixed
allocated size for storing network graph information, the sync speed can be
improved by **up to 25%**â€”a huge boost in efficiency!

Reviewing this PR was both insightful and enjoyable. It gave me a deeper
understanding of RGS and the optimizations that make it even more efficient.
Definitely a great learning experience! ðŸš€

# Log 121: "A Day of Learning"

> 28 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Attended multiple workshops on various Bitcoin projects at the Bitcoin Summit.
- Updated CI for **Blinded Path No Offer**.
- Added final touches to the presentation.

## Reflections:

What a beautiful day. It began on a calm noteâ€”we gathered in a serene spot
surrounded by nature and spent the day immersed in thoughtful discussions on
freedom tech. From the latest BOLT updates like the peer manager, to new
companies offering Bitcoin services without KYC, the conversations were
wide-ranging and deeply engaging.

Amid all this curiosity and inspiration, I also carved out some quiet time to
clean up recent workâ€”fixing the CI for yesterdayâ€™s update and polishing the
final details of my upcoming presentation.

An amazing end to an amazing day. ðŸŒ¿âœ¨

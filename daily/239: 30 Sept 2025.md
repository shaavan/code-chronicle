# Log 239: Completing the Picture

> 30 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Implemented] creation logic of payment dummy hops.

## Reflections

With the major chunk of the parsing logic for dummy hops in place, today was
about tackling the other half of the puzzle: **creation**.

Reading code only takes you so far—you can reason about correctness, but nothing
proves it like running the system end-to-end. Implementing creation logic is the
step that turns abstract parsing into something testable, verifiable, real.

Tomorrow is testing day. And with that, I’m aiming to hit a personal milestone:
logging the PR before the month closes.

Let’s play.

# Log 151: "Making Sense of Dummies"

> 12 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Addressed](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726#issuecomment-2873240521)
  and
  [discussed](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726#issuecomment-2873297276)
  a fresh round of suggestions for
  [#3726](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726).

## Reflections:

After a very thorough review by my peer, I sat down to both **address the
suggestions that felt right** and **defend the ones I believed in**.

And for both sides of that equation, one thing remained constantâ€”they became
catalysts for deeper insight. I had to revisit my own assumptions, retrace my
design choices, and ask myself the "why" behind decisions Iâ€™d taken for granted.
That kind of introspection is what makes working on this project so fulfilling.

It's not just about codeâ€”it's about sharpening clarity through dialogue,
deepening understanding through resistance, and coming out the other side with
more aligned thought.

To days of insight, learning, and doingâ€”cheers to that. ðŸ¥‚

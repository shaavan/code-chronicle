# Log 29: "On Documentation"

> 26 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated documentation for
  [Custom TLVs](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830).

## Reflections:

Documentation—the cornerstone of any good software, yet often one of the most
overlooked aspects. The difference between a confusing chunk of broken English
and a clear, beautiful explanation of technology lies in great documentation.

I truly appreciated its importance today as I worked on writing documentation
for one of my older PRs. Writing good documentation is enlightening—it requires
stepping into someone else’s shoes to explain things in a way that makes sense
to them. It’s a true test of how deeply and from how many angles you understand
your own creation.

Today was an eye-opening experience.

# Log 178: _Using Technology!_

> 23 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Added final touch-ups and cleanups to the
  [`No Blinded Path Offer`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/blinded_api-18)
  branch

## Reflections:

While adding the final layers of polish to the Blinded API branch today,
something clicked — not in the code, but in the way I approach my role.

I realized that one of the core responsibilities of a PR author is to
**pre-review their own work** — not just for correctness, but to smooth out all
the rough edges before a reviewer ever sees it. That way, reviewers can focus on
what matters most: architecture, intent, and long-term soundness, rather than
getting caught in fixable minutiae.

And while I’ve always aimed to do that manually, today I leaned into the tools
we now have at our disposal. Alongside refining the code, I also set up a
**systematic review flow for my future PRs** — a way to double-check formatting,
logic, and quality automatically before every push.

It felt like a shift — not just polishing code, but **upgrading the way I show
up** as an open-source developer.

A quiet but meaningful day of professional upskilling.

# Log 144: "Fruit of Persistance"

> 02 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated Dummy TLVs PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726#issuecomment-2847272195)
  with a working fix.
- [Addressed Flow suggestions](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-27)
  based on recent mentor feedback.

## Reflections:

After days of investigation, iteration, and support, I finally landed on a
solution for the **Dummy TLVs** issue. I couldnâ€™t have done it without the kind
and thoughtful help of my colleague, who guided me through the last few hurdles.
Iâ€™m deeply grateful to be working alongside peers like thisâ€”people who make the
hard things easier simply by being around.

On the Flow front, I began addressing the suggestions discussed during Tuesdayâ€™s
mentor meeting. The work moved forward smoothly, and Iâ€™m now just a step or two
away from wrapping it up and updating the branch.

A wonderful and productive dayâ€”one that reminds me how progress is always
sweeter when shared. ðŸš€

# Log 44: "Victorious Finish!"

> 13 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Implemented the new approach for
  [#3246](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246).

## Reflections:

Finally finished—uff!

Today was truly something. It was a long day of figuring out the flow,
implementing the steps, backtracking a bit, and finally emerging victorious.
After more than six hours of work (which felt like half an hour in the zone), I
successfully implemented the new
"[Router-based](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3246.14)"
approach for
[#3246](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246).

This new approach builds on earlier discussions but takes things a step further,
resulting in what I believe is a much cleaner solution (at least in my opinion
;)). I’m excited to see what the rest of the team thinks of it!

What a fun and satisfying day—it’s moments like these that make the effort so
worth it!

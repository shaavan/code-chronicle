# Weekly Log 47: Winds of Closure, Waves of Breakthrough

> 12 – 18 November 2025

## Overview

This week moved in two distinct rhythms: the calm completion of polished work,
and the intense final push through one of the toughest technical challenges I’ve
faced in months.

It began with review rounds, refinements, and tying off long-pending threads.  
It ended with a true breakthrough — the moment when the Blinded Payment Dummy
Hops finally clicked into place after weeks of struggle.

A week of shifting winds, steady hands, and one very welcome “Eureka.”

## Highlights

- **Wrapped up and completed** the final reviews on [#4126], bringing the PR to
  a clean, finished state.
- **Updated and refined** the pay-dummy branch after fresh suggestions and
  internal clarity.
- **Documented** bottlenecks and coordinated with colleagues to align on the
  last few tricky parts of the dummy hops design.
- **Prepared** the first draft PR for recurrence, refining data structures and
  documenting design decisions thoroughly.
- **Achieved a complete breakthrough** on Blinded Payment Dummy Hops — all
  issues resolved and the core logic functioning cleanly.
- **Set the stage** for upcoming work: polishing recurrence and preparing dummy
  hops for final review.

## Reflections

If last week was about clearing fog, this week was about following the wind.  
Some days asked for calm: finishing reviews, tightening loose ends, pushing
steady progress.  
Others demanded courage: returning to the thorniest parts of dummy hops, cutting
through confusion, and accepting help where needed.

And then, finally, came the shift — the internal click where the entire problem
aligned, and the solution emerged cleanly. “Eureka” wasn’t an exaggeration; it
was the honest emotional truth of the moment.

This week taught me that breakthroughs don’t arrive by force.  
They arrive after patience, clarity, documentation, collaboration — and the
persistence to try the 1001st approach after the first thousand fail.

A good week.  
One that moved both the codebase and me forward.

# Log 64: "Big Wins!"

> 11 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Introduced the
  [implementation](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3246.16)
  for Offer with No Blinded Path.
- Opened the
  [Currency](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3525) PR.

## Reflections:

After days of effort on my end and invaluable reviews from my mentor, Iâ€™m
thrilled to have introduced the
[Currency PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3525) and
the latest
[implementation](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3246.16)
for Offer with No Blinded Path.

Today feels like a huge win and the culmination of persistent hard work! Iâ€™m
incredibly grateful to my mentor for their guidance throughout this journey.

Looking forward to the reviews from my peers on both PRs. Onwards to the next
steps with renewed energy! ðŸš€

# Log 115: "Let's Do It Again..."

> 20 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Retried solving
  [#3320](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/i3320b).
- Made progress on the **Bitcoin Summit presentation** content.

## Reflections:

After getting all my active PRs up to date with reviews, I decided to revisit
one of the older unresolved issues—**#3320**.

The last attempt had hit a roadblock: I wasn’t able to open a new channel
between the test nodes, nor claim the payment on-chain. So today, I took a
different route—**first breaking down each step to understand the root causes**,
then **creating a simpler test version** to tackle the problem incrementally. I
can feel the pieces starting to come together now, and I’m hopeful that tomorrow
will bring more clarity and progress.

In the latter half of the day, I focused on my **presentation prep for the
Summit**. I now have a solid **base structure and topic outline**. The next step
is to start translating this into visuals and storytelling flow.

A fun, focused day—and an even more exciting one awaits tomorrow!

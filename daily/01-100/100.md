# Log 100: "Brainstorming"

> 27 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **[Brainstormed](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412#discussion_r1973569389)**
  on finding a middle ground for `OffersMessageFlow`.

## Reflections:

Today, I took a deep dive into the entire discussion surrounding the **direction
and design of `OffersMessageFlow`**, analyzing the different perspectives my
colleagues had put forward.  
For a quick **summary** of the debate:

- Should `Flow` **handle everything**, even at the cost of exposing too much of
  its internal workings in the public API?
- Or should `Flow` act as a **lightweight utility**, leaving `ChannelManager` in
  controlâ€”at the cost of making things harder for users who opt out of
  `ChannelManager`?

(If you grasped that in one go, congratsâ€”youâ€™re a tech ninja! ðŸ¥· If not, I
highly recommend reading through the
[discussion](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412#discussion_r1968450306).)

To find balance, I proposed a **middle-ground approach**â€”`Flow` still does
everything, but instead of borrowing functions from `ChannelManager` (which
exposes them to the API), it **directly borrows from the source**, keeping them
out of the public API. I think this approach has potential, and Iâ€™m eager to
hear my colleagues' thoughts!

ðŸŽ‰ **Side Note:** This marks **Log 100,** ladies and gentlemen! âœ¨  
Proud of the journey so far, and even prouder for sticking with it for **100
logs, across weeks and months.**  
**To 100â€”and many more to come! ðŸš€**

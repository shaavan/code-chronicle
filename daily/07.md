# Log 07: "Padding Analysis & Implementation"

> 30 Oct 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Analyzed the optimal padding size for rounding off Message and Payment TLVs.
- Implemented an approach to apply the right amount of padding.

## Reflections:

Today was productive, even with a long day of traveling! I carved out some
quality time to make progress on padding analysis. Using general field values, I
calculated median TLV sizes and ran an analysis to ensure effective
padding—masking TLV sizes without adding excessive padding that would waste
space.

This approach yielded solid results, and I was able to implement a method for
optimal padding!

On a personal note, with the year passing, we've reached the most auspicious day
for every Indian—the day of destroying all evils and returning home after a long
journey. Diwali is here! To everyone Indian at heart, and anyone who feels at
home after a long journey, I wish you a beautiful Diwali!

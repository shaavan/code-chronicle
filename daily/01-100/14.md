# Log 14: "A Big Change!"

> 09 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Refactored most of the offers code from `ChannelManager` to
  `OffersMessageFlow`
  [link](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/b63ec048eb10c9f5e9b6f733d3e62314f8571bb1).

## Reflections:

While debugging `OffersMessageFlow`, I realized that a step-by-step refactor
wasnâ€™t going to cut it. Much of the offers flow in `ChannelManager` is
interdependent, so to get it working properly, I needed to make all the changes
at once.

Embracing the challenge, I cleaned up the branch and started refactoring one
function at a time. Today has been incredibly gratifying! Iâ€™m so pumped to see
this through that Iâ€™ll be making time over the weekend to get it done and see it
in action!

Have a great weekend, everyone! I know I will! ðŸŒŸ

# Log 312: After the Finish Line

> 21 Jan 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on follow-up work for dummy hops

## Reflections

After finally **finishing the dummy hops branch**, I shifted gears today and
started planning the follow-up work.

The main focus was reasoning through how to introduce **dummy hop expenses**
into the `PaymentClaimable` and `PaymentClaimed` events. With the core
implementation now complete, this feels like the natural next step toward making
dummy hops fully visible and accounted for in the system.

It feels good to close such a large milestone — and just as good to immediately
see a clear path forward from it.

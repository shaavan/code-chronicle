# Log 185: Building on the Shoulders of Giants

> 04 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Progressed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/3845-mac) the
  work on [#3845](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3845),
  introducing Poly1305-based authentication.

## Reflections:

After a longer-than-expected recovery from a seasonal flu, today marked my
return to rhythm — and I chose to begin by building on the foundations laid in
PR #3845, which introduces Poly1305-based authentication into the codebase.

My focus was on replacing the hardcoded key values with a proper key source
abstraction, allowing users to provide or reuse keys as needed. This refactor
brought its own set of challenges, but I was able to work through them with
clarity. Tomorrow, the plan is to extend this foundation to support key usage
specifically within `BlindedMessagePath` TLVs, particularly for DummyTlvs.

It felt good — not just to return, but to return stronger. Picking up where I
left off, and continuing the work with purpose and momentum. Truly, I feel the
strength of standing on the shoulders of those who’ve paved the path.

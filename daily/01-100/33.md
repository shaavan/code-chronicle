# Log 33: "Presenting BOLT12"

> 30 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Delivered a presentation on BOLT12.
- Made minor fixes to
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3412.04).

## Reflections:

Today, I gave my presentation on BOLT12. I was both excited and nervous
beforehand, but I’m so happy to say that it went even better than I expected!

I started with a brief introduction to BOLT12, explaining how standard Lightning
transactions work. From there, I outlined how BOLT12 addresses the core problem
of reusability and enhances privacy through Blinded Paths. The crowd was
incredibly engaging, and their questions turned the end of the talk into a
fascinating discussion.

It was a truly wonderful day, and I’m so grateful for this experience!

# Weekly Log 5 (2026): Insight, Closure, and Momentum

> 29 Jan 2026 – 03 Feb 2026

## Overview

This week blended deep technical insight with deliberate closure and steady
forward motion. I made a key breakthrough on **dummy hops fee accounting**,
closed out lingering work on **BOLT11 custom TLVs**, and balanced implementation
progress with planning for the months ahead. It was a week of understanding
_why_ things behave the way they do — and using that clarity to move forward
thoughtfully.

## Highlights

### Dummy Hops: Understanding the Fees

- Made a decisive breakthrough on a subtle fee discrepancy in **dummy hops** by
  reconciling aggregated blinded-path fees with per-hop fee deduction semantics.
- Identified the missing invariant: test expectations rely on **finite base fees
  with zero proportional fees**, ensuring aggregated fees equal the sum of
  per-hop fees.
- Continued progress on the **dummy hops follow-up**, including work toward
  separating dummy-hop-earned fees into dedicated payment claimable fields.
- Advanced the follow-up branch while deliberately working around a stubborn
  blocker to maintain momentum.

### Custom TLVs: Clean Landing

- Brought the **BOLT11 custom TLVs** PR to a clean, complete state after
  addressing remaining review suggestions.

### Planning Ahead

- Spent focused time refining the **proposal for the coming year**, stepping
  back from implementation to shape a clearer narrative and direction.
- With fresh perspective, the proposal began to cohere, setting up a strong plan
  to finalize in the coming days.

## Reflections

This week felt well-paced and intentional. Breakthroughs came not from brute
force, but from asking the right questions — especially around fee semantics and
test invariants. At the same time, closing out older threads created space to
think more clearly about what comes next.

Even with a brief health slowdown toward the end of the week, progress continued
by choosing the right problems to work on. Understanding deepened, loose ends
tightened, and the path forward became clearer.

A satisfying balance of insight, closure, and momentum.

## Reflections

Today, I wrapped up the final steps of the dummy hops PR.

After the last round of reviews, the core logic was in place. Only a few small
quirks remained to be ironed out—and with those handled, the branch is now in
its final form. I’m excited to see this get merged and finally bring dummy hops
into the message path flow.

Of course, one milestone only clears the way for the next.  
Next up: dummy hops for _payment_ paths. That one should be a fun exercise—more
complex, more experimental, and definitely more opportunities to break things in
creative ways.

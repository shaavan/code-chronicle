# Log 273: Almost Recurring

> 24 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Implemented] the recurrent Invoice Request handling mechanism

## Reflections

Today brought real progress toward wrapping up the recurrence project.

With the field introductions and builders already in place from earlier work, I
focused on implementing the **core logic for Recurrent Invoice Request
handling**.

The first step was a useful bit of refactoring — rebalancing responsibilities
between `ChannelManager` and flow-level code. This allowed for a cleaner
integration of recurrence checks and basetime calculation logic.

With that done, there’s just one major piece left: introducing the **period
calculation** and **paywindow logic**. After that, it’ll be time for final
polish and opening the draft branch — something I’m (cautiously) optimistic
about sharing here _tomorrow_.

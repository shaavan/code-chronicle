# Log 90: "The Flow Takes Shape"

> 13 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Restructured
  [`Flow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/omf-32).

## Reflections:

Finally, after hours of focused effort, unshaken resolve, and sheer will—I did
it. **Flow** is now structured into something concise, coherent, and truly
_flowing_ the way it was always meant to.

I’m deeply satisfied with the work I put in today. It feels like sculpting a
rough block of marble into something refined, something meaningful.

Today, I can proudly say: I have _earned_ the rest.

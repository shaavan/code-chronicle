## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on the Currency PR

## Reflections

Today was about refining and strengthening the currency support work.

First, I cleaned up the overall approach to make the introduction of currency
support feel more intentional and less bolted on. The goal is for the design to
read naturally — as if it always belonged in the architecture.

Second, I added clearer documentation and guidance on how users should interpret
amounts and integrate currency conversion. Since the responsibility boundary is
subtle, good documentation is part of the design itself.

Finally, I introduced currency support within the internal code paths, ensuring
the model holds up beyond just the public API surface.

It was steady, structural progress. The shape of the PR is becoming cleaner and
more coherent.

A good day of forward movement.

# Log 281: On a Side Quest!

> 04 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on introducing custom TLVs in the BOLT12 flow

## Reflections

Today, I took a break from the main recurrence arc to focus on a side quest.

In our last meeting, my mentor mentioned a small but meaningful addition:
supporting **custom TLVs** during BOLT12 payment flows. This would allow the
payer to send additional data to the payee — anything from descriptions to
authentication hints — as part of the invoice payment process.

I decided to explore this space today, thinking through different approaches and
tradeoffs:  
Should we send the data via the TLV stream in the invoice request path? Or
through an onion message?  
Should the custom TLVs be attached at the time of invoice request creation, or
injected later when initiating the payment?

Most of today was spent scouting the landscape, reading through relevant parts
of the codebase and protocol logic. I didn’t finalize a solution yet, but I now
have a clear sense of direction and what needs to be decided.

The side quest continues tomorrow — and it’s looking like a fun one.

# Log 294: Seeing that Reveals

## What I Worked On

- [Addressed] review feedback on the currency and event-model PR

## Reflections

Today was focused on addressing suggestions on the **currency** and
**event-model** PRs. The [review][Review] was detailed and thoughtful, which
made the process especially valuable.

While working through the feedback, I found myself revisiting my own assumptions
and retracing the reasoning that led me to the current design. It forced me to
articulate _why_ things were structured the way they were, and where that
reasoning held up — or didn’t.

By the time I finished [addressing the comments][Addressed], I felt I had a
clearer and more grounded understanding of my own work than when I started.

Here’s to more reviews like this — the kind that don’t just improve the code,
but improve the author as well.

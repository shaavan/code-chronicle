# Code Chronicle

Welcome to **Code Chronicle** â€” a daily log of my open-source development
journey. This repository is a space where I track my daily coding activities,
progress, challenges, and reflections. It serves as a structured journal to
maintain accountability, learn from each day, and document my path as an
open-source developer.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Keep a clear and organized record of daily work and accomplishments. -
  Document challenges and solutions encountered along the way. - Reflect on
  progress and maintain a habit of continuous learning. - Provide a transparent
  view of my development process for personal growth and collaboration.

## Structure

- The repository is divided into two types of logs: **Daily** & **Monthly**. -
  **Daily Logs** contain a brief description of achievements and challenges
  faced on that day. - **Monthly Summaries** provide a detailed overview of the
  problems solved, lessons learned, and development progress over the course of
  the month.

## Inspiration

Code Chronicle is inspired by the idea of combining structured progress tracking
with personal reflection. As an open-source developer, this journal helps me
stay accountable while allowing me to look back and learn from my journey.

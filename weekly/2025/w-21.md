# Weekly Log 21: _From Flow to the First Seeds of Currency_

> Week of 15 May – 18 May 2025

## Highlights:

- Wrapped up final review suggestions for the `Flow` PR — now on the cusp of
  merge.
- Stepped into planning async-based follow-ups: **Offer currency support** and
  **BOLT12 assessors**.
- Created the first draft of the Currency implementation.
- Encountered an edge case with `Refund` that may influence future spec
  discussions.

## Reflections:

This week felt like closing a long arc and opening a new one.

On the 15th, I wrapped up the final wave of review suggestions for the Flow PR.
It was one of those rare days when code, review, and clarity all lined up — the
comments were positive, and I could feel the momentum building. It’s almost
ready to land, and that sense of completion felt incredibly grounding.

The very next day, I pivoted into thinking about what’s next — and
unsurprisingly, Flow gave rise to its own branches: support for currencies in
Offers, and an event-driven BOLT12 assessor model. Friday was full of sketches,
async design brainstorms, and mapping how user interaction can be woven into
these message flows.

By the weekend, it was time to stop sketching and get my hands into code again.
I drafted the first implementation for Currency, only to discover that Refunds
don't yet support fiat-denominated amounts structurally. That small blocker
opened up deeper questions: _Should they?_ And what does it mean to validate or
reject such a field in practice?

That’s what I’ll be exploring next. But stepping back — this was a rewarding
week. One chapter is closing, and a new one is already writing itself.

Here goes the next climb.

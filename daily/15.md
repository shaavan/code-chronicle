# Log 15: "OffersMessageFlow Compiling"

> 10 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Created the working version of
  [offersmessageflow](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/310dbb0ef35a18c59e6055e47f2d17bc40e6da71).

## Reflections:

As I promised myself, I was able to find some quality time to work on the
branch, and finally create a working version of the offersmessageflow branch.
The branch compiles as it is intended too, expect there are a few tests that are
failing, which I would be debugging tomorrow! For now, I am rejoicing in the
fact that I was able to create a clean compilable version of the branch, and
that made my Sunday even more better! Man, I love working on my job!

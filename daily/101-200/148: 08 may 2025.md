# Log 148: "Asynchronous Flow"

> 08 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated Flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2863812184)
  based on feedback from the async payments side of LDK.

## Reflections:

Today brought a fresh wave of insights—thanks to a thoughtful review from one of
the core devs working on async payments in LDK. Since `OffersMessageFlow`
interacts closely with BOLT12, it naturally overlaps with the asynchronous side
of payments. Their feedback shed light on several nuanced improvements I hadn’t
fully seen before.

Working through those suggestions, I realized just how much beauty there was
still waiting to be chiseled out from code I had already written. It reminded me
of something essential: the same codebase, under a different set of attentive
eyes, can reveal new dimensions—ones that were invisible just yesterday.

Grateful to be surrounded by such a sharp and generous community. This is what
collaborative development is all about.

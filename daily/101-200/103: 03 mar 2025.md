# Log 103: "Almost There"

> 03 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finished the **new OffersMessageFlow proof of concept**.  
  [Branch Link](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-02).

## Reflections:

After days of restructuring and conceptualizing, I finally got the **first
version of the new Flow trait and OffersMessageFlow implementation** out there!

The branch is **almost complete**, with just a few final refinements left to
address. It feels great to see the approach coming together and moving toward
something solid.

Proud of the progressâ€”wish me luck for the finishing touches! ðŸš€

# Week 14: "Momentum Reclaimed"

> Week of 31 March 2025 â€“ 02 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **Dummy Hops
  ([#3252](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3252))**  
  Kicked off implementation of dummy hopsâ€”a technique to insert self-directed
  hops before the final TLV, enhancing onion packet obfuscation. Spent time
  prototyping and brainstorming efficient data transfer across dummy hops
  without bloating payload size.

- **Discussion & Strategy Across PRs**  
  Held an in-depth sync with my mentor covering key branchesâ€”**Flow**, **No Path
  Offer**, and **Dummy Hops**. We explored design trade-offs, clarified
  blockers, and discussed the direction for upcoming changes.

- **Progress on
  [#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658)**  
  Addressed most suggestions on this PR, with only a minor test fix pending. The
  feedback loop was productive and helped refine implementation clarity.

- **Significant Updates to No Path Offer
  ([#3246](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246))**  
  Revisited and updated the branch after a long pause, restructuring the
  implementation to be DRY and more readable. This brought the feature close to
  completionâ€”soon enabling Offers and Refunds without requiring blinded paths!

## Reflections:

This week felt like a **return to full rhythm.** With many long-running threads
(Flow, No Path Offer) coming back into focus and new ideas (Dummy Hops)
emerging, it was all about **gathering scattered momentum and channeling it
forward.**

The mentor discussion was especially helpfulâ€”it aligned priorities and unblocked
confusion, allowing me to move swiftly across multiple fronts. Getting No Path
Offer back on track was particularly satisfying, not just technically but as a
symbolic continuation of a paused chapter.

Thereâ€™s plenty still to build, but itâ€™s clear the ground is prepared. Here's to
another week of meaningful motion! ðŸš€

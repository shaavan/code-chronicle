# Log 244: Emerging Simplicity

> 08 Oct 2025

## What I Worked On

- Fixed and simplified the Dummy Blinded Path approach.

## Reflections

Today was fast-paced and focused, with one goal in mind: **get dummy hops for
blinded payment paths working in the simplest way possible.**

I didn’t quite reach the finish line, but I can confidently say it’s in sight.

After my discussion with my mentor, I spent some time sitting with the problem,
and something interesting revealed itself. Imagine this: at runtime, four layers
of upstream-to-downstream functions are called in sequence:

A → B → C → D

Each layer has its own interpretation logic, its own way of understanding what
kind of hop it’s dealing with (forward, receive, etc.) and how to process it.  
My original approach was to introduce dummy hops as a _new kind of hop_, with
unique properties and handling at every single layer: A, B, C, and D. It worked,
but it was cumbersome.

Then the insight struck.  
If dummy hops are truly _dummy_, just arbitrary data, why process them through
every layer at all?

Instead, I realized that if I can simply peel the dummy layer at the end (in
`D`), then re-inject the revealed layer back into `D`’s input queue, the entire
process can repeat naturally, with no need to modify A, B, or C at all.  
A minimal, elegant loop.

It’s such a clean solution, and one I couldn’t have reached without my mentor’s
help.

Today I took the first steps toward implementing it. It’s still unpolished, but
the design feels right.  
A day of good progress, where simplicity naturally emerges from chaos!

# Weekly Log 23: _A Merge, A Breakthrough, and Momentum_

> Week of 29 May â€“ 03 June 2025

## Highlights:

- Finalized and merged the long-standing
  [`Flow`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639) PR ðŸŽ‰
- Solved architectural design and implementation of the new `Dummy Hops` model
- Reverted locking-order-breaking iterator changes for stability and clarity
- Finalized and polished the release-ready version of the `Flow` event model

## Reflections:

This week marked the **culmination of months of work** â€” Flow, my
longest-running PR so far, was finally merged. What began as an idea grew
through design iterations, reviewer feedback, CI bugs, and subtle refactors â€”
and this week, it quietly landed in the codebase. Itâ€™s hard to overstate how
satisfying that moment was.

But the week didnâ€™t pause there.

I also solved a tricky design problem in `Dummy Hops`: introducing
authentication **only** for the first hop. The final implementation emerged not
through rigid planning, but by flipping my usual problem-solving approach â€”
going top-down instead of bottom-up. That inversion made the problem clearer and
the solution surprisingly elegant.

Meanwhile, Flowâ€™s journey continued â€” this time through the event model. I
implemented the final batch of feedback, discussed the design with my mentor,
and we finalized the release-ready version for wider peer review. A new arc is
forming, and this one feels more focused thanks to everything the last taught
me.

This week was about **finishing well and starting strong** â€” closing one loop
and setting the pace for what comes next.

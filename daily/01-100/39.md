# Log 39: "Warming Up to Reviews"

> 7 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Reviewed PRs
  ([#3446](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3446),
  [#3449](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3449)).

## Reflections:

With all my PRs updated and waiting for reviews, I decided to shift gears and
focus on reviewing others' work. To warm up my reviewing abilities, I started
with a couple of PRsâ€”light enough for me to review thoroughly and recent enough
to expect feedback from the authors.

This was a fun and insightful exercise, and who knows? It might just become a
new habit in the coming days! :)

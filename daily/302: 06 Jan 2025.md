# Log 302: The Gate Opens...

## What I Worked On

- [Opened] the payer flow PR

## Reflections

And today… finally… after days, weeks, and months of work building up to this
point, I present the **recurrence payer flow**.

After yesterday’s push, I realized there were still a few bits of polishing
left. Once those were addressed, the draft PR was finally ready — and it’s now
out in the open.

This feels like a good moment for a quiet celebration, a bit of well-earned
rest, and then a return to the journey: improving the PoC, responding to
feedback, and picking up the other threads waiting in the wings.

Onward!

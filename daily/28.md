# Log 28: "Getting Everyone Together"

> 25 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated two of my other open PRs:
  [Padding](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177) and
  [Custom TLVs](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830).

## Reflections:

Today, I took a moment to reassess my priorities and realized that in my effort
to tame a megalith, I had maybe left some of my other work a bit neglected. To
make up for it, I dedicated the day to making progress on these PRs and bringing
them closer to completion.

Looking forward to updating my other works tomorrow too! âœ¨

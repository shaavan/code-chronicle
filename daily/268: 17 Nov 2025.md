# Log 268: The First Shape of Recurrence

> 17 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Prepared] the first draft PR for recurrence.

## Reflections

Today I decided it was time to bring recurrence out into the world.  
Spec implementations are large creatures — too big to conquer in one sweep — so
the only real way forward is step by step, update by update, carrying your
reasoning with you as you go.

With that in mind, I focused on shaping the first draft PR. I revisited every
data-structure decision I’d made so far, refined what needed clarity, and began
documenting each choice extensively — not just for myself, but so anyone reading
the PR can understand the flow without repeatedly bouncing back to the spec.

There’s a little more polish left before it’s ready to publish, but the skeleton
is there, and it feels solid.  
Tomorrow, I aim to finish the refinements and let the work step into the light.

A good day of good work.

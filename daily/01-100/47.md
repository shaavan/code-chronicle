# Log 47: "Lining Up the Path Ahead"

> 17 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Continued work on the asynchronous BOLT12 message support.
- Discussed upcoming issues and projects with my mentor.

## Reflections:

I spent quality time today refining the new BOLT12 message handler trait,
pushing the asynchronous implementation further. Later, I had a fruitful
discussion with my mentor about potential projects I can take on next.

I’m truly excited to say that I now have plenty of engaging challenges on my
plate—projects I’m eager to tackle!

Looking forward to a productive and fulfilling holiday week ahead!

# Week 52: "Closing Loops and Expanding Horizons"

> Week of 22 Dec 2024 - 26 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

This week was a mix of finalizing older tasks, tackling ongoing challenges, and
building new features. Here’s a summary of the key highlights:

- **Finalizing Async BOLT12 Handling and Currency Support**: I worked on
  expanding and perfecting the async BOLT12 message handling branch, focusing on
  cases where `InvoiceRequest` amounts are missing and where offers involve
  currencies. The updated approach handled these nuances effectively, bringing
  the branch close to completion.

- **Padding Analysis Finalized**: Revisiting the `Padding` branch, I finalized
  the values after incorporating feedback from my mentor. The updates included
  separate padding for payment TLVs, distinguishing between Offers and Refunds.
  The branch was expanded to include a new test for the updated logic, and with
  this, one of my older PRs is now ready to merge.

- **Issue Investigations**: I tackled
  [#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320), which
  involved a tricky “deadlock” scenario with locked HTLCs and closed channels.
  While the solution remains elusive, the struggle highlighted the complexity of
  the issue and the need for deeper exploration.

- **Expanding the `Bolt12Assessor` Trait**: I introduced greater flexibility to
  the `Bolt12Assessor` trait, allowing users to handle currency-specific support
  and assess `InvoiceRequest` and `Invoice` messages. The updated approach
  enhances the system’s flexibility, clarity, and user experience.

## Reflections:

This week was a fulfilling blend of finishing older tasks and laying the
groundwork for future progress. Finalizing the `Padding` branch felt especially
rewarding, as it tied up one of my earlier contributions. Tackling
[#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320) remains a
challenge, but it’s a reminder that persistence is key to overcoming tough
problems.

The expansion of the `Bolt12Assessor` trait marked a step forward in improving
usability and flexibility, reflecting the iterative nature of building clean and
effective systems.

Overall, this week was a satisfying balance of closure and exploration—perfectly
timed as we transition into the New Year. Here’s to more challenges,
breakthroughs, and meaningful contributions ahead!

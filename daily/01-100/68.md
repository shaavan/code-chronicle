# Log 68: "Building Momentum"

> 14 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Continued progressing on the
  [`user_custom_tlv`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/custom_tlvs-12)
  branch.

## Reflections:

On a festive day, I carried forward yesterdayâ€™s work, focusing on refining and
progressing the `user_custom_tlv` branch. I addressed the remaining comments and
pushed closer to completing the branch.

With most of the work now complete, Iâ€™m optimistic about updating the PR early
tomorrow. Feeling productive and looking forward to wrapping this up! ðŸŽ‰

# Log 314: A good simple day

## What I Worked On

- [Updated] the custom TLVs for BOLT11 PR

## Reflections

Today was a simple day.

I noticed a few remaining suggestions on the **custom TLVs for BOLT11** PR and
focused on addressing them one by one. No detours, no scope changes — just
steady cleanup and refinement.

A good, simple day.

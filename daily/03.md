# Log 03: "Visiting the Past"

> 25 Oct 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Revisited an
  [old draft PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830) to
  introduce Custom TLVs in Onion Messages.

## Reflections:

Going back to the past was an eye-opener. First off, I realized how rough my old
code was! But from a different perspective, itâ€™s amazing to see how far Iâ€™ve
come in my LDK journey. Thereâ€™s definitely some truth to the saying:

> "If youâ€™re not embarrassed by who you were twelve months ago, youâ€™re not
> learning."

While tackling this issue, I hit a roadblock with introducing custom TLVs for
payment receive TLVs. Iâ€™ll work on overcoming that hurdle tomorrowâ€”wishing
myself all the best! ðŸ¤ž

# Log 293: Exploring the Landscape

> 20 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- Explored the LDK Node and LDK Server repositories

## Reflections

Today, over the weekend, I decided to take a short break from my ongoing work
and spend some time exploring other major projects in the LDK ecosystem — areas
where I could potentially add value over time.

I focused on two projects in particular:

- **LDK Node**, which builds on top of `rust-lightning` and defines the
  parameters and integrations needed to operate a full node.
- **LDK Server**, which uses LDK Node to provide a daemon-based interface,
  making `rust-lightning` usable through RPC calls and external tooling.

Both projects were interesting to explore and helped me better understand how
`rust-lightning` fits into the broader LDK stack. I’m excited to dig deeper and
see where I might be able to contribute to these projects in the coming days.

A calm but insightful day of exploration.

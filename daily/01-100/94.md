# Log 94: "From walk to a light jog"

> 19 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated
  [`RouteParametersConfig`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3342.12).
- [Addressed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/custom_tlvs-16)
  rebase and CI fixes.

## Reflections:

Today, I spend time getting things into momentum. Today, I took a little faster
stroll. And today, I got a bit more done. And I am so happy that yielded into
[something good](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342#issuecomment-2669122416).
Let's keep the momentum going, and let's get more things done in the coming
days! ðŸš€

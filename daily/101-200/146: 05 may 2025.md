# Log 146: "Putting Forth"

> 05 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Finished Flow suggestions](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-28).
- [Discussed](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246#issuecomment-2851362590)
  the future approach for the No Path Offer PR.

## Reflections:

After a streak of focused effort, I finally wrapped up the remaining Flow
suggestions! Now the last step before I update the branch is to ensure CI
passes—then this piece is good to go.

Once that was done, I returned to one of my earlier PRs and reread the last
thread of discussion. For the first time, I found myself not fully in agreement
with the direction the conversation was heading. And instead of defaulting to
agreement or brushing past it, I paused—sat with my thoughts—and took time to
**articulate my concerns** clearly and respectfully.

Writing them out helped me realize there was solid reasoning behind my
discomfort. I then discussed these thoughts with my mentor, who encouraged me to
share them publicly—and even affirmed the validity of my stance.

It felt genuinely good to **stand by my intuition**, back it with logic, and
have it be acknowledged by someone I look up to. A great reminder: clarity,
honesty, and respectful dialogue always move the work forward.

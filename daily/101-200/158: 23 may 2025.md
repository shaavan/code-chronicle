# Log 158: A Day of Perfectionism

> 23 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finished addressing Flow’s
  [suggestions](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2905245662)

## Reflections:

After covering the first half of changes yesterday, I wrapped up the remaining
Flow updates today. But before pushing the branch, I took another review pass —
this time, with a perfectionist’s lens.

And that’s when I found it: a handful of small quality-of-life improvements just
waiting to be made. So I folded those in too.

While at it, I figured it was finally time to clean up some lingering CI
failures that had been hanging around for a while. Nothing too dramatic — just
giving Flow the polish it deserves.

It feels good to work like a perfectionist sometimes. Not always, not forever —
but on days like these, it’s oddly satisfying to chase that extra 5% that no one
asked for but you know matters.

Quiet joy in quiet craft.

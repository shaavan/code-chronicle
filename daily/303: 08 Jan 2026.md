## What I Worked On

- [Addressed] review suggestions for custom TLVs in BOLT11 payments

## Reflections

After opening the gates for the payer flow earlier this week, I decided to
return to some of my other open threads. To my pleasant surprise, a few reviews
were already waiting.

Today, I focused on addressing feedback for **custom TLVs in the BOLT11 invoice
flow**. The suggestions were thoughtful and helped clean up the implementation
further. After working through them, the PR feels noticeably more polished and
coherent.

At this point, it looks close to being ready for merge — which is always a
satisfying place to be.

And we move forward!

# Log 06: "The Spell Worked! The OffersMessageFlow Conjured"

> 29 Oct 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Created a first working
  [branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/tree/offersmessageflow) of
  `OffersMessageFlow`, refactoring the `OffersMessageHandler` into the struct.

## Reflections:

Today was incredibly productive! I managed to conjure up a working draft of the
`OffersMessageFlow`. The journey took me deep into the uncharted parts of the
codebase, and I learned so much about the intricate dependencies between primary
modules and submodules. It’s been eye-opening to see how introducing a new
primary module fits into this mix.

Big shout-out to [Jeff](https://github.com/jkczyz), my mentor, for all the
guiding points and for helping me navigate so many roadblocks along the way.
Super grateful! 🙇‍♂️🌟

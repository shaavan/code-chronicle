# Weekly Log 30: _Threads of Completion_

> Week of 19 July – 22 July 2025

## Highlights:

- Revisited and restructured the Dummy Hop branch after merging of
  `ReceiveAuthKey` PR
  ([#3917](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3917))
- Finalized and submitted the Q5 OpenSats Report
- Continued work on Event-Model enhancements for currency handling and Bolt12
  manual responses
- Fixed a lingering bug in Dummy Hop padding logic and synced the implementation
  with the new authentication flow

## Reflections:

This was a week of looking back, stitching things together, and moving forward
with renewed clarity.

I began by returning to the Dummy Hop logic. With `ReceiveAuthKey` now a part of
the codebase, many of the older authentication steps could be stripped away. The
clean-up felt less like a refactor and more like pruning a tree — the structure
already in place, now allowed to breathe.

In parallel, I started preparing the Q5 report. It wasn’t just about listing
accomplishments. It became a process of re-seeing the past — not as fragmented
PRs, but as a coherent arc of progress, decisions, and learnings. There’s always
a quiet pause in this part: to ask, “Did this quarter hold up to the vision I
had for it?” This time, the answer felt grounded.

Alongside all this, I also expanded the Event-Model to support clearer currency
handling and laid out the helper scaffolding for manual responses to Bolt12
messages. And somewhere between all of this, I found and fixed a subtle bug in
Dummy Hop padding — one of those details that doesn’t scream, but matters.

A short week, but a full one. Closure, clarity, and quiet pride.

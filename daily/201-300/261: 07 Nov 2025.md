# Log 261: Building Recurrence

> 07 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Continued] work on the **Recurrence** implementation.

## Reflections

After yesterday’s breakthrough, I decided to shift gears today — turning my
focus back to **Recurrence** and working toward bringing it fully to life.

The idea was simple: the flow is already designed, so now it’s time to express
it in code.  
The day went smoothly, spent reasoning through data structures, choosing the
right representations, and putting the foundational implementation in place.

Tomorrow’s plan: refine the work, polish the edges, and weave in the remaining
core logic.  
Excited to see the flow come together — one step closer to making recurrence
real.

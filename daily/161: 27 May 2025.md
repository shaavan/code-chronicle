# Log 161: On Solving & Exploring

> 27 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Reattempted solving the bugs in
  [#3514](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3514)
- Discussed the generalized event model for Flow with mentor

## Reflections:

Today, I revisited an old problem from PR #3514 — expanding a test to ensure
that even when a channel is closed due to a stale ChannelManager, we can still
successfully claim the HTLC on-chain.

While I managed to properly simulate the on-chain claim, the payment still
fails. After digging in again, I found myself at the same roadblock as before.
It’s one of those tricky corners where I know a little guidance from a senior
could light the way forward.

Later in the day, I discussed the finalized generalized event model for Flow
with my mentor. It was a good sync — grounding the architecture and surfacing
some new directions to explore tomorrow.

A solid day of wrestling with bugs and planting ideas — equal parts challenge
and curiosity.

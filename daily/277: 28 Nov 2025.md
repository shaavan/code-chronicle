- Addressed [payment dummy hops][DummyHopsComment] suggestions

## Reflections

Today, while my team on the other side of the world enjoys a well-earned rest
for Thanksgiving, I decided to spend the day working with our least-appreciated
team member: the one and only **coderabbit**.

After publishing the first draft of the recurrence branch two days ago and
fixing CI issues, I figured this would be a great moment to ask coderabbit for a
[review][RecurrenceCodeRabbit] — not just for low-level nits, but for high-level
structure and consistency.

And honestly? It delivered. There were several subtle issues I might’ve only
caught _much_ later during testing. Thanks to the rabbit, I caught them early
and cleaned things up with confidence. I feel good about the refinements this
brought to the recurrence flow.

Then, I turned my attention to the payment dummy hops — and
[again][DummyCodeRabbit], coderabbit didn’t disappoint. It even caught a
significant issue: a risk of losing an HTLC due to a moved data field between
releasing and taking a lock.

That kind of bug would’ve been painful to debug later, but now it’s resolved.
Dummy hops are now in a much better place.

So — thank you, coderabbit.

Tomorrow, we continue onward — this time toward implementing the **payer flow**.

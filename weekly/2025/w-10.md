# Week 10: "Flow Finalized & A New Path Forward"

> Week of 03 March 2025 â€“ 04 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was all about **bringing the alternative Flow approach to life** and
**getting it ready for review**. Hereâ€™s what I accomplished:

- **Finalized the new OffersMessageFlow implementation**

  - Completed the proof of concept and refined the structure.
  - Ensured that **Flow and ChannelManager integration** was smooth and
    well-structured.

- **Opened the PR for the alternative Flow approach**

  - [PR #3639](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639)
  - Overcame roadblocks in parameterizing ChannelManager with Flow.
  - Ensured that the approach was well-tested and functional.

- **Discussed refinements & optimizations with my mentor**
  - Identified ways to **improve usability and efficiency** of the Flow
    approach.
  - Planned follow-ups to implement these optimizations.

## Reflections:

This week was **short but intense**, focused entirely on **getting the new Flow
approach out there**. The process of refining and structuring the Flow was both
**challenging and rewarding**â€”each hurdle tackled made the implementation
**stronger and more robust**.

Now that the PR is live, the next step is to incorporate feedback and **make it
even better**. Looking forward to the **next phase of iteration and
improvements!** ðŸš€

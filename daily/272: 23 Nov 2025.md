# Log 272: State and Momentum

> 23 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] the recurrence draft implementation

## Reflections

Continuing from yesterday’s work, I made solid progress on completing the
**payee flow for recurrence**.

The key steps today were:

- Adding support for creating offers _with_ recurrence
- Introducing a map in `ChannelManager` to track the recurrence data for active
  sessions

I’m glad to have kept the momentum rolling throughout the weekend — and this
puts me in a strong position to make meaningful strides as the new week begins.
If all goes well, I’ll be opening the draft early in the week.

Onwards!

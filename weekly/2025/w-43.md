# Weekly Log 43: Peaks and Paradoxes

> 18 – 21 October 2025

## Overview

This week felt like standing at the summit of one challenge, only to see the
next peak rising ahead.  
After weeks of incremental progress, the long-awaited breakthrough finally came:
the Dummy Payment Hops parsing mechanism came to life. What followed was an
equally rewarding — and humbling — stretch of debugging, as I began integrating
the system into the Default Router and watching it behave in ways both expected
and delightfully unpredictable.

## Highlights

- **Achieved breakthrough** on the Dummy Payment Hops parsing logic after
  persistent refinement.
- **Integrated** the mechanism into the Default Router implementation.
- **Investigated** a trio of failing tests — the “Three Horsemen” — each
  revealing unique edge cases in fee handling, event propagation, and HTLC
  failure modes.
- **Documented** and mapped out the debugging plan for upcoming iterations.

## Reflections

If last week was about reaching a milestone, this one was about _understanding
it deeply_.  
Finishing the core feature was gratifying, but seeing how it interacts with the
larger system was the real teacher. Each bug felt less like an obstacle and more
like a dialogue — the code explaining itself in its own language.

There’s something deeply satisfying about this stage: when success is already
earned, but refinement still calls.  
The thrill of discovery continues, just on a quieter, subtler frequency.

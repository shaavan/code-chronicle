# Log 69: "Finishing Strong"

> 15 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Completed addressing all comments on the
  [`custom_tlvs`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/custom_tlvs-12)
  branch.

## Reflections:

Despite feeling under the weather, I pushed through and managed to finish
addressing all the comments for the `custom_tlvs` branch. Itâ€™s a relief to wrap
this up, and I feel like Iâ€™ve earned the rest of the day to recover.  
Sometimes, even on tough days, persistence pays off. ðŸ˜Š

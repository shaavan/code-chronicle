## What I Worked On:

  [addressing](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3514#discussion_r1908852657)
  comments and fixing
  [#3514](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3514).

## Reflections:

On a relaxed Sunday, I focused on addressing comments from my draft PR. One
comment pointed out that if there’s an active channel between nodes, the
transaction can be claimed on-chain. However, when I attempted to open the
channel, I noticed some unusual behavior—Alice’s node wasn’t generating a
required event for channel creation, which blocked the process.

I spent a few hours diving into the issue and managed to identify the source
function, but I couldn’t fully grasp the reason behind the problem. Recognizing
the value for discussion, I shared my findings with my peers and sought their
input to uncover the root cause.

This reminded me once again: meaningful progress is often built on collaboration
and discussions. Excited to see where this leads!

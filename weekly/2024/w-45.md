# Week 45: "Progress and Perseverance"

> 04 Nov 2024 - 10 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

This week was marked by tackling technical complexities in `OffersMessageFlow`,
overcoming roadblocks, and bringing the project closer to completion. Here’s an
overview of the key progress points:

- **Lifetimes and References**: Early in the week, I faced the challenge of
  Rust’s lifetime and borrowing rules, grappling with both the constraints and
  strengths of Rust's system—a humbling but insightful experience.

- **Problem Solving and Mentorship**: Midweek, I hit a breakthrough in the
  `OffersMessageFlow` refactoring thanks to a brainstorming session with my
  mentor. A small but crucial fix resolved what felt like a mountain of issues,
  reminding me of the power of collaboration and perseverance.

- **TLV Distinctions**: I introduced custom TLV distinctions based on their
  source, recognizing two origins within a received Onion message—those from the
  sender and those within our reply path. This abstraction was an important step
  in progressing `OffersMessageFlow`.

- **Testing and Refinement**: Introducing custom TLV tests uncovered some
  unfinished areas in the long-drafted PR. Through testing, I was able to
  identify and address these issues, bringing the code closer to a real sense of
  completeness.

- **First Working Version**: By the weekend, I had created a clean, compilable
  version of `OffersMessageFlow`. Although a few tests still need work, it was a
  satisfying milestone that capped off a productive week.

## Reflections:

This week reinforced the value of perseverance, collaboration, and the
importance of testing. I was reminded of Seneca’s words: _“No man is more
unhappy than he who never faces adversity. For he is not permitted to prove
himself.”_ This week embodied that sentiment—each obstacle brought growth and a
renewed appreciation for the work I do.

From discovering hidden issues to celebrating each hard-won success, this week
was both challenging and rewarding. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity
to learn and push forward in work I truly love. Looking forward to more progress
in the days ahead!

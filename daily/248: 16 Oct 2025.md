# Log 248: Steady Steps

> 16 Oct 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on implementing the **sending recurrent payment flow** for
  recurrence.

## Reflections

Today was a simple, steady day — gradual progress toward the goals I’ve set my
eyes on.  
After outlining the general flow for recurrence, I decided it was time to get
hands-on before I fell into the trap of overengineering on paper.

I made good progress setting up the base for recurrence — defining variables and
implementing their serialization.  
Next, I’ll focus on getting the core recurrence logic in place.

Onwards.

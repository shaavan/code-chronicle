# Log 245: Here Comes Dummy!

## What I Worked On

- [Opened] Dummy Hops for Blinded Payment Paths PR.

## Reflections

Finally, it’s out. I opened the draft PR. The parsing path still feels too raw
to call review ready, so I took the straighter route.

There are three pieces to dummy hops: their existence, their builder, and their
parsing. It didn’t make sense to block the first two behind the third, so I
shipped the parts that are solid and left parsing to mature next. This gets real
code in front of eyes, enables early feedback, and lets tests start exercising
the shape of the feature.

Next up: stabilize parsing, thread it through the pipeline, and wire up
end-to-end tests. The tie-off is in sight.

# Log 16: "OffersMessageFlow Structured & Ready (Almost)"

> 11 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Structured the
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/a6d28b67c2d1be38c509a9f2faa7560396fe5a80)
  branch and discussed improvements with my mentor.

## Reflections:

After structuring the branch, I had a productive chat with my mentor to identify
areas for improvement. Following our discussion, we nailed down some clean-up
steps to create a more refined, streamlined version.

Looking forward to making those improvements tomorrow!

## What I Worked On

- [Opened] Custom TLVs PR

## Reflections

After a few days of focused effort, and to bring a satisfying close to the week
— I present to you: **Custom TLVs!**

The PR is now open and ready for review. I’m happy to have shipped the first
reviewable version within the week, and I’m looking forward to seeing what
feedback my peers have to offer — especially the improvements I might have
missed.

Next week begins with review cycles, iteration, and the next step forward.

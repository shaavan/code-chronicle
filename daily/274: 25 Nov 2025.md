## What I Worked On

- [Finished] the payee flow of recurrence

## Reflections

After hours of pushing through the gnarlier challenges of recurrence logic, I’ve
finally wrapped up the **payee flow**.

Along the way, I made sure to maintain not only solid documentation, but clear
reasoning behind each action and sub-action — so future-me (and reviewers) don’t
have to guess why anything exists.

Now that all the core work is done, all that remains is writing a proper commit
message, a detailed PR description, and then… opening the actual PR. But that’ll
have to wait until tomorrow.

See ya.

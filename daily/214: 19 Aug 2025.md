## Reflections

The focus today was bringing closure to the currency approach I wrapped up
yesterday. I cleaned up the final details, prepared the branch, and set it up
for a PR.

With that complete, I used todayâ€™s meeting to shift gearsâ€”looking beyond the
immediate work toward the longer arc of my journey. Together with my mentor, I
explored future directions, the kind of projects that matter most, and how I
might contribute to them meaningfully.

In that conversation, I saw new horizons begin to take shape. The path ahead
feels wide open, and Iâ€™m just getting started. ðŸš€

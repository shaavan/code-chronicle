# Log 124: "No Path Offer goes brrr..."

> 02 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed suggestions and made updates to the
  [No Path Offer](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3246.18)
  PR.

## Reflections:

Today was a **single-minded focus day**â€”I dedicated all my energy to refining
and updating the No Path Offer branch.

The most challenging (and satisfying) part was figuring out **how to DRY up the
logic**â€”cleaning the code while still keeping it **clear and readable**. It took
a bit of back-and-forth thinking, but Iâ€™m glad with where it landed.

At this point, the branch feels nearly complete. With a few rounds of review,
**LDK will soon support Offers and Refunds with no blinded paths**â€”a small but
meaningful milestone!

Feeling accomplished. Time for a deep breath before the next push. ðŸš€

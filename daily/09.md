# Log 09: "Lifetimes & Borrow. The Gift & the Curse."

> 04 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Continued with the `OffersMessageFlow` refactoring.

## Reflections:

Creativity flourishes within the presence of rules. But what happens when the
rules become too obscure, too complicated? When the system becomes almost
Kafkaesque, where accomplishing something feels like an endless chain of
references?

Today was a day of struggle—a struggle with Rust’s lifetimes and references.
Rust’s magic lies in its rules, but today, I saw another side: the constraints.
As with anything in life, one has to see all sides to truly appreciate it.
Though I may not feel it right now, today’s experience has deepened my
appreciation for Rust and its rules.

Some might say the day yielded no results, but I’d direct them to Edison’s
words: _"I have not failed 1,000 times. I’ve successfully found 1,000 ways that
will not work."_ Today reminded me of the truth in that.

Tomorrow is a new day, with new challenges and new learnings. Through struggles
and victories alike, we grow.

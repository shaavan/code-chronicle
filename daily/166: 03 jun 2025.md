# Log 166: Moving Forward!

> 03 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Discussed and finalized the release-ready
  [version](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-03) of
  Flow’s event model

## Reflections:

After the high of yesterday’s Flow merge, today was about channeling that
momentum into the next phase — the **Flow event model**.

I focused on implementing the final set of mentor suggestions and had a
productive discussion to review the current state of the branch. Together, we
identified the last improvements needed before this version is ready for public
peer review.

It felt like a day of powerful forward motion — sharp focus, clear direction,
and a strong sense of progress.

The arc continues — and we’re moving with it.

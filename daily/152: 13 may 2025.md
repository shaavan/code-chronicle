# Log 152: "Flow Clean-Up!"

> 13 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Fixed](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2877417590)
  remaining Flow issues.
- Addressed final comments to improve async support.

## Reflections:

Today was all about **adding the final touches to Flow**â€”cleaning things up,
refining the async logic, and addressing the last round of comments to get it
truly ready for merge.

It feels great to see it all come together after so many iterations. What began
as an ambitious rework has now shaped into a solid, review-ready piece of the
puzzle.

Excited to see this one land! ðŸš€

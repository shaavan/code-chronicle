# Week 18: "Refinements, Revelations, and Flowing Forward"

> Week of 27 April 2025 – 29 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- ✅ **Fixed Flow CI** after a long debugging process and committed the final
  stable version
  ([Log 140](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2833504866)).
- 🔍 **Investigated the Dummy Hops decoding failure**, narrowing it down to a
  mysterious issue where the decoding fails _only_ when dummy hops are
  present—despite the shared secrets being correct.
- 📚 **Collaborated on Flow direction**: Discussed future design options with
  mentor, including supporting **both custom and default Flow** through dual
  constructors.
- 🧹 **Refactored `PaymentClaimable` field structure in
  [#3655](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655#issuecomment-2838441135)**
  — merging `channel_ids` and `user_channel_ids` into a single, clear tupled
  vector to avoid ambiguity and ensure alignment.

## Reflections:

This week was a quiet, determined stretch of refinement and uncovering subtle
truths.

Fixing the Flow CI took patience, iteration, and trust in the process—but the
moment the checks turned green, it felt like breathing fresh air after a long
climb.

On the Dummy Hops front, the investigation was rich and oddly poetic. Despite
identical shared secrets, the decoding failed silently when dummies were
involved—a riddle half-solved, a mystery still breathing. The pursuit continues.

And then there was the thoughtful cleanup: the `PaymentClaimable` structure now
carries clarity, mapping user IDs and channel IDs together, reducing confusion
and strengthening future use.

Amid all this, the Flow conversation with my mentor stood out. We began shaping
its future: one constructor for control, one for convenience. Two doors, one
vision. The architectural questions are growing deeper—and so is the sense of
purpose behind them.

Another week where progress was less about big wins, and more about **precision,
clarity, and momentum**.

Here’s to unfolding the rest—thread by thread. 🪡

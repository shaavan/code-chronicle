# Log 330: Walking the Edge

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on introducing dummy skimmed fees in `PaymentClaimable`

## Reflections

After finally resolving the two remaining test failures last week, I shifted
focus to the UX side of the dummy hops follow-up — specifically, exposing dummy
skimmed fee information to users via `PaymentClaimable` and `PaymentClaimed`
events.

This turned out to be more involved than I initially expected. The solution path
I’m exploring is efficient, but not without trade-offs, and it sits in a space
that invites debate around design clarity versus practical usefulness.

Rather than prematurely optimizing for consensus, I want to push the approach
forward far enough to see it working end-to-end. Having something concrete will
make the discussion more grounded and productive.

I plan to review the progress with my mentor tomorrow.

An interesting edge to explore.

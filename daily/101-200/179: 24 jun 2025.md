# Log 179: _Exploration in the Horizon_

> 24 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Explored](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-10) the
  trait-based approach for the Flow event model
- [Finished](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246#issuecomment-3000054274)
  the No Blinded Path Offer branch

## Reflections:

Today was a day of charting into the _beyond_ — moving past enums and runtime
checks, and into the world of **traits and compile-time guarantees**.

The goal: to design a system where the user doesn’t need to consult
documentation to use it correctly — because the design itself **makes misusage
impossible**.

And today felt like a genuine step in that direction.

I implemented the initial trait-based framing for `InvoiceRequest` in the event
model, upgrading from the enum-based pattern we'd used so far. The update was
met with affirmation during my discussion with my mentor — both in principle and
in execution. That felt reassuring.

Meanwhile, I also finalized the **No Blinded Path Offer** branch — cleaning,
rebasing, and closing that arc with care.

The next step is to mature the traitification model and bring it into
publishable form.

A good day — standing at the edge of the known, looking forward to what's next.

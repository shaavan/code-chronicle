# Log 128: "Finding Purpose"

> 08 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Discussed ideas and potential design directions for:
  - [Issue #3669](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3669)
  - [Flow PR #3639](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639)

## Reflections:

Today was a day of centeringâ€”**clearing doubts, finding clarity, and aligning
with purpose.**  
Two major questions had been lingering over the past few days, each carrying
significant weight in terms of design and long-term direction.

The first was about **how to expose an API for reply path creation**
([#3669](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3669)) that is
not only truly useful but also meaningfully different from the existing ones.
The goal is to make it intuitive for users to create blinded paths _without
entangling them in unnecessary overlap_ with current abstractions.

The second centered around **Flow**â€”how to shape `OffersMessageFlow` such that
it **truly decouples the Offers logic from ChannelManager**, while still
offering enough flexibility to allow for plug-and-play functionality (like async
or custom evaluators) in the future.

Both challenges initially felt tangled and a bit overwhelming. But through deep
discussion, reflection, and intentional thinking, I found the **answers I was
seeking**. The path forward for each is now **clearer than ever**â€”and all that
remains is the steady walk toward completion, one step at a time.

To finding the pathâ€¦ and walking it. ðŸª·

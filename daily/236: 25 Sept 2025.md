# Log 236: Layers and Entry Points

## What I Worked On

- [Opened] PR for AAD-based verification of blinded payment paths.
- Made [progress] on dummy hops for blinded payment paths.

## Reflections

Today was a productive one.

Not only did I refine and open the PR for AAD-based verification, but I also
built on top of it—making solid progress toward implementing dummy hops for
blinded payment paths.

There’s an interesting challenge ahead:  
How should the dummy hops be “peeled off”? Should I approach it recursively?  
Or should I re-enter the existing hop-handling pipeline at the right stage to
account for dummy hops cleanly?

It’s a subtle, design-driven choice—and one that’ll shape how cleanly this fits
into the existing logic.

Looking forward to exploring the solution tomorrow. It’s one of those _good_
problems.

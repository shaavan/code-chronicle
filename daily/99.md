# Log 99: "Updates, Updates, Updates on the Way"

> 26 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **Fixed CI** for
  [`Custom Data`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr2830.15).
- **Updated**
  [`BOLT11 Payment Flow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3617.03),
  addressing suggestions.

## Reflections:

Today was all about **updates**â€”fixing CI for an old PR and refining a new one
based on feedback.

With these changes, I believe both **Custom Data** and **BOLT11 Payment Flow**
are in great shape and ready to be merged in the coming days!  
Exciting times ahead! ðŸš€

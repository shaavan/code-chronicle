# Log 61: "Laying the Groundwork"

> 06 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Researched the codebase to solve the second part of
  [#3381](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3381).

## Reflections:

Today was all about research and understanding the problem at hand. The issue
focuses on introducing coverage for cases where
`MonitorUpdateCompletionAction::FreeOtherChannelImmediately` is generated during
the initial setup.

I delved into how these events are generated in the first place and explored
ways to trigger the exact event in a testing environment. The research yielded
some promising results, as I was able to map out a rough idea of how this
triggering could happen.

With this groundwork laid, Iâ€™m optimistic about creating a working draft to
address this issue tomorrow. Here's to making progress! ðŸš€

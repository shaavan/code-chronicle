# Log 311: Polishing and Reframing

> 19 Jan 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Addressed] the final batch of suggestions for payment dummy hops
- Studied and planned an updated currency conversion strategy

## Reflections

For the first part of the day, I focused on polishing and pushing the latest
**dummy hops** updates. With those changes addressed, the feature feels very
close to being fully wrapped up.

After that, I returned to the **currency conversion** work. Following a thorough
[discussion][CurrencyDiscussion] on the direction to take, we aligned on moving
toward a **synchronous approach**, which should serve as a better long-term
solution.

Rather than applying a quick fix on top of the existing branch, I decided to
treat this as an opportunity for a deeper cleanup — revisiting earlier
assumptions and improving parts of the design that I didn’t fully appreciate
when I first wrote the PR.

I’m excited to dive into this update process tomorrow.

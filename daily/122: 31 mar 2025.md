# Log 122: "Let the Dummies In!"

> 31 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Started work on **Dummy Hops**
  ([Issue #3252](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3252)).

## Reflections:

With the
[Padding PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177)
finally merged and Flow likely to take a little longer to settle, I decided it
was the perfect time to sink my teeth into **Dummy Hops**.

The challenge is fascinating: I need to ensure that just before the final TLV
packet, we inject a series of **self-directed dummy hop packets**—each
forwarding the message to itself, repeatedly, until the final node receives and
processes the intended TLV.

The tricky part lies in **efficient data transfer**—making sure dummy hops don’t
consume too much space, while still carrying enough information to allow the
final payload to arrive intact.

After a good amount of brainstorming and hands-on attempts, I now have a rough
mental model of how this might work. Hopefully, tomorrow brings the “click” that
puts everything in place.

A day of challenge—and quiet hope. 🌱

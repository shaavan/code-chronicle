# Log 170: _Problem Solved_

> 09 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Solved and completed the implementation of the new Dummy Hop approach

## Reflections:

Last week, I had been working on a refined Dummy Hop approach — one that reduces
overhead by applying authentication only to the **first** dummy hop, rather than
all of them.

The concept was clear, and the skeleton was in place. But I hit a stubborn bug
during decoding: the subsequent hop node wasn’t being parsed correctly. It was
one of those issues where everything _looked_ right — until it wasn’t.

Today, after a good stretch of focused debugging, I finally cracked it. The
decoding now works cleanly, and the approach is fully implemented. Just a few
final cleanups remain before I push the update to the branch.

A solid day of problem-solving — the kind that quietly reminds you why you love
this work.

# Log 296: Following the Map

> 26 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on the payer flow implementation

## Reflections

Today was a day of pure engineering — building directly on the map I laid out
earlier.

There were a few concrete sub-tasks planned around introducing a **constant
payer signing public key** for recurrence, and I made solid progress through
them.

First, I introduced the explicit signing public key methods, which was a
significant milestone. Next, I wired the corresponding `KeyPair` into the
`ChannelManager`’s outbound recurrence session data, storing it alongside the
active session state.

The final piece I’m currently working through is designing the `KeyPair`
creation logic itself — ensuring that the derived key is unique, safe to use,
and correctly threaded through invoice creation in
`pay_for_offer_with_recurrence`.

Before the week ends, I plan to complete this logic and fully wrap up the
constant signing public key flow.

Cheers to steady, meaningful progress.

# Log 112: "Another Flow Served"

> 17 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Completed the finished version of the new Flow
  [branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-10).

## Reflections:

After pouring my heart into the new approachâ€”**restructuring, refining, and
addressing every nook and cranny**â€”I was finally able to put together the
**complete version of Flow**.  
Not just a minimal proof-of-concept, but a **full-fledged implementation** that
cleanly moves all Offers-related logic out of `ChannelManager`.

It feels incredibly satisfying to reach this milestone.  
Tonight, Iâ€™ll sleep wellâ€”because todayâ€™s rest feels earned. ðŸ˜Š

# Weekly Log 03: Bringing Things Home

> 15 Jan 2026 – 19 Jan 2026

## Overview

This week was about closure and recalibration. It began with reflection and
writing, then transitioned back into focused engineering — polishing
long-running work to the point of merge, while also stepping back to rethink
direction where a deeper redesign was warranted.

It was a week of finishing threads cleanly and setting the stage for the next
iteration.

## Highlights

### Writing and Reflection

- Spent the first part of the week preparing and finalizing the **Q7 quarterly
  report**.
- Reviewed the past quarter’s work, identified common themes, and shaped a clear
  narrative around progress and learning.
- Closed out a writing-heavy stretch and transitioned back into implementation
  work.

### Payment Dummy Hops Near Completion

- Addressed the final rounds of review feedback for **payment dummy hops**.
- Polished the implementation based on senior reviewer suggestions.
- Reached a point where the feature feels stable, coherent, and close to merge
  readiness.
- Began planning follow-up work to improve the test framework and expose dummy
  hops cleanly through the public API.

### Currency Conversion: Reframing the Approach

- Revisited the **currency conversion** work after detailed discussion with
  collaborators.
- Aligned on a synchronous approach as a better long-term direction.
- Chose to pause incremental fixes in favor of a deeper cleanup and redesign of
  the existing branch.

## Reflections

This week reinforced the importance of knowing when to close a chapter — and
when to reopen one thoughtfully.

Finalizing the quarterly report provided a valuable pause to reflect, while
returning to dummy hops felt like bringing a long-running effort to a clean
landing. At the same time, revisiting the currency conversion strategy was a
reminder that sometimes progress means stepping back, questioning assumptions,
and choosing a more robust path forward.

Overall, it was a balanced week: reflective without stalling, productive without
rushing. The kind of rhythm that keeps both the work — and the worker — in a
healthy place.

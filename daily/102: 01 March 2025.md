# Log 102: "Sailing the Storms"

> 01 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Worked on the **new OffersMessageFlow approach**.

## Reflections:

The difference is more significant than I expected. Since the entire idea is
flipped on its head, we now need a completely different way of handling
things—**creating a system of delegation that keeps `ChannelManager` in charge
while allowing `OffersMessageFlow` and `Flow` to do most of the work**.

On top of that, I need to carefully decide **which functions should remain in
`Flow` for public API use and which should become internal helpers within
`OffersMessageFlow`**. It’s a tricky balance, and figuring it out has introduced
more questions than answers.

But if past experience has taught me anything, it's that confusion is often a
sign of progress—the **storm before the clear skies**. I’ll keep building on
today’s efforts to refine a solid, working approach soon.

To stormy sails—for they yield the brightest treasures! 🌊⚡️🚀

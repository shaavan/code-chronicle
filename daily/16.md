# Log 16: "OffersMessageFlow Test Fix"

> 11 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Finalized a correct and working version of
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/4df78329b90dbf0785fb35ba4c5a94b8c3aeee1c).

## Reflections:

The branch is finally complete! The code works as expected, and the refactor is
done. There's just one more step before opening the PR: arranging the commits,
updating the documentation, and writing the PR description.

Excitedly waiting for tomorrow!

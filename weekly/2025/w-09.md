# Week 09: "From Refinements to Reinvention"

> Week of 24 Feb 2025 â€“ 01 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was a mix of **final refinements** and **new explorations**â€”wrapping
up long-standing work while simultaneously flipping an entire approach on its
head. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key accomplishments:

- **Finalizing Bolt11 Payment Flow**:  
  I addressed the last set of suggestions for the
  [Bolt11 Payment Flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3617),
  refining the structure and ensuring it aligns with `RouteParametersConfig`.
  The PR is now in great shape and ready for merging.

- **Fixing & Updating Custom Data**:  
  I spent time fixing **CI issues** for the
  [Custom Data PR](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr2830.15),
  ensuring itâ€™s aligned with the latest changes and maintaining compatibility
  with recent updates.

- **Brainstorming & Implementing an Alternate OffersMessageFlow Approach**:  
  After deep discussions, I explored a completely **new approach** for
  [OffersMessageFlow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412).  
  The
  new design **reverses dependencies**, aiming to delegate most of the work to
  `Flow` while keeping `ChannelManager` in control. Implementing this shift
  requires careful restructuring, particularly in deciding **which functions
  should remain public and which should be internal helpers**.

## Reflections:

This week was **a journey through different stages of work**â€”**wrapping up
polished implementations, fixing past issues, and diving into a brand-new
architectural shift**.

While the **finalization of the Bolt11 Payment Flow** was satisfying, the real
challenge came with **OffersMessageFlow**â€”**breaking old assumptions,
questioning dependencies, and restructuring from the ground up**. The deeper I
got into it, the more complex it became, but I know this phase of uncertainty is
part of the process.

As I step into next week, I aim to **refine and solidify the new
OffersMessageFlow approach**, bringing clarity to the storm. Exciting times
ahead! ðŸš€

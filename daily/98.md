# Log 98: "Merges & New Ideas"

> 25 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **Finished**
  [`RouteParametersConfig`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342)
  ðŸŽ‰
- **Fixed**
  [`Custom Data`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr2830.15)
  CI.
- **Discussed** an
  [alternate approach](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412#discussion_r1968450306)
  for `OffersMessageFlow` with my mentor.

## Reflections:

Today was an incredibly productive day, tackling multiple tasks across different
areas!

For starters, I **fixed the CI for Custom Data**, followed by addressing the
last remaining follow-ups for **RouteParametersConfig**â€”and **it got merged
today!** ðŸŽ‰ Always satisfying to see long-term work come to completion.

Beyond that, my mentor and I explored an interesting suggestion for
**OffersMessageFlow**. The idea proposes a completely **reversed dependency
structure**, where instead of `OffersMessageFlow` being parameterized on
`ChannelManager`, **`ChannelManager` would be parameterized on
`OffersMessageFlow` instead.**  
Itâ€™s an intriguing shift in design, and Iâ€™m excited to **spend some quality time
exploring it tomorrow!**

A fun and fulfilling day indeed! ðŸš€

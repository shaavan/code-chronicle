# Log 35: "Charting next steps"

> 3 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Discussed next year’s proposal ideas with my mentor.
- Updated
  [`Custom TLVs`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr2830.09),
  addressing comments.

## Reflections:

Today, I had a deep dive discussion with my mentor about potential ideas for
next year’s proposal. We explored a variety of possibilities, and I’m glad we
had such a fruitful discussion to understand what I can start exploring now
before finalizing a direction.

Later, we shifted focus to live reviewing
[`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412).
We identified some excellent points for improvement, which I’ll work on
tomorrow.

Proud to say it was a productive and rewarding day!

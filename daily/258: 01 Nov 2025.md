# Log 258: A Thousand Failures

> 01 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on solving the third issue for **Payment Dummy Hops**.

## Reflections

Today was the day of a thousand failures.  
My single goal: solve the test issue with the Payment Dummy Hops.

I finally traced the source — the `intro_blinded_point`, which should’ve held a
value, was being set to `None` for the final `ReceiveTlvs` whenever dummy hops
were added. I spent the entire day trying to track down how it was being set,
and why the introduction of dummy hops disrupted it. I gave it everything I had.

And yet, all I found were a thousand ways it _wasn’t_ solved.

But strangely enough, in this down moment, I feel… hopeful.  
Because tomorrow, I’ll wake up knowing a thousand things _not_ to do — and that
puts me a thousand steps closer to the one that works.

So, I’ll rest tonight.  
And maybe, tomorrow will be my lightbulb moment.

# Log 38: "Metacoding"

> 6 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated the
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412)
  branch with all suggestions addressed and CI resolved.
- Developed a local CI tool to mirror the remote CI process.

## Reflections:

Finally, after another focused effort, I was able to update the
[`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3412.06)
branch, addressing all suggestions and resolving CI issues.

While working on the CI, I realized the biggest bottleneck was the lag between
pushing the branch to the remote repository and waiting for CI tests to run. To
address this, I built a local CI tool that mirrors the remote process, speeding
up future fixes.

It was a fun and rewarding exerciseâ€”coding a tool to improve the coding process
itself. Metacoding at its best! ðŸ”¥

For my future reference and for anyone who might find it helpful, hereâ€™s the
tool I created for local CI checks:

---

### **`check-commits` Script**

A tool to validate commits locally by mimicking remote CI processes, including:

- Validating the last `<number-of-commits>` or commits from a specific
  `<commit-hash>`.
- Running `rustfmt` checks (excluding files listed in `rustfmt_excluded_files`).
- Performing `cargo check`, `cargo doc`, and additional checks for specialized
  configurations.

#### Script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to validate either the last <number-of-commits> commits
# or all commits from a given <commit-hash> to the latest commit in the current branch.
# Also runs `rustfmt --check` for all files except those in the rustfmt_excluded_files.

    echo "Repository has uncommitted changes. Please commit or stash them first."
    exit 1

if [[ "$INPUT" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then

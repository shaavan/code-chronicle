# Log 278: Mapping the Payer Path

## What I Worked On

- Finished designing the payer recurrence flow

## Reflections

Today, on a calm weekend, I decided to give myself a challenge:  
**Could I design the entire payer flow for recurrence in one day?**

The goal was to think through the full process end-to-end — identify what needs
to be implemented, sketch out the data structures, and plan the commit structure
for development.

And honestly, I’m glad to say I hit about 80% of that goal. The major pieces are
in place, and the harder design problems are already solved. What's left is
finalizing the commit layout and preparing to bring the plan to life.

Tomorrow, with the fresh momentum of a new week, I’ll take this design and start
transforming it into working code. One step closer to completing recurrence —
from both sides of the protocol.

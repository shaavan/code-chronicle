# Log 133: "Flowing with the Reflection"

> 16 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed latest
  [Flow updates](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-17).
- Finished the **Q4 report**.

## Reflections:

Today felt like a gentle current finally catching speed. I spent the first half
of the day addressing the latest set of updates on the Flow, and I’m genuinely
happy with how far it’s come. After rounds of effort, iteration, and refinement,
it felt good to receive
[this comment](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#pullrequestreview-2769314663)
from a peer. Little moments like that—when the effort starts to speak for
itself—make the whole journey worthwhile.

In the second half, I shifted gears and wrapped up my **Q4 report**. Just a few
touch-ups remain before I share it with my mentor.

A wonderful, well-rounded day—equal parts creation and reflection.

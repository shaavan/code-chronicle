# Log 96: "RouteParamsConfig Part-2"

> 22 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Began working on the **follow-up** for `RouteParametersConfig`.
  - [Branch link](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/i3262b-1).

## Reflections:

With the original `RouteParametersConfig`, which introduced the new struct and
implemented it for BOLT12, **almost done**
([status update](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342#issuecomment-2669122416)),
I decided it was time to **begin its follow-up**â€”expanding similar
configurability for **BOLT11**.

Building on
[PR#3342](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342), I spent
the day **mapping out a plan of action** and implementing the **basic workable
design** for integrating a new **BOLT11 payer** in `ChannelManager`. And Iâ€™m
happy to say that **both goals were accomplished before the day's end**!

Next up: **introducing tests, cleaning up the implementation, and structuring
the PR for submission**.  
Tomorrowâ€™s going to be **fun**! ðŸš€

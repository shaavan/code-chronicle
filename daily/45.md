# Log 45: "A Light Weekend"

> 14 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated the analysis for the
  [`Padding`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177)
  branch.

## Reflections:

Embracing a slower weekend, I focused on updating the analysis for the optimal
padding value for Payment TLVs. With the merge of the
[`Payment TLVs Authentication`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3435)
branch, the size of `ReceiveTlvs` changed. To account for this, I updated my
[analysis](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/tree/padding-test).

With these updates, I believe the `Padding` branch is now ready to be merged
into the codebase. I’m hopeful it will be finalized before the year ends!

Wishing everyone a restful weekend—goodbye for now!

# Weekly Summary: "Taming the Megalith"

> Week of 11 Nov 2024 - 16 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

This week was all about bringing the ambitious `OffersMessageFlow` project to
its final stages. From addressing feedback to refining the structure and
completing documentation, here’s a summary of what I accomplished:

- **Addressing Feedback**: I kicked off the week by implementing suggestions
  from my mentor, refining the branch’s structure, and improving the approach to
  ensure cleaner and more maintainable code.

- **Atomizing the Megalith**: Midweek, I tackled the challenge of making
  `OffersMessageFlow` atomic, addressing the interconnectedness of functions,
  structures, and tests. After several iterations, I found a workable solution
  that streamlined the codebase while maintaining functionality.

- **Finalizing Implementation**: By the end of the week, I had completed the
  implementation of key components, including `OffersMessageHandler`,
  `create_offer_builder`, and `create_refund_builder`. With just two parts
  left—`pay_for_offer` and `request_refund_payment`—I could finally see the
  finish line.

- **Writing Documentation**: With the implementation complete, I turned my
  attention to writing clear, comprehensive documentation for the
  `OffersMessageFlow` branch to ensure it’s ready for submission.

## Reflections:

This week felt like a sprint to the finish line for one of the most ambitious
projects I’ve undertaken in my journey with Lightning. It was a week of
persistence, experimentation, and growth, as I tackled technical complexities
and embraced the challenge of refining such a massive piece of work.

The satisfaction of seeing `OffersMessageFlow` come together has been immense,
and I’m grateful for the support and guidance from my mentor along the way. Now,
as I shift my focus to documentation, I’m filled with pride and anticipation for
sharing this work with the world.

Here’s to wrapping up this project and taking a well-deserved moment to
celebrate!

# Log 210: A Day of Gratitude

> 12 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated [#3726].
- Discussed [currency] approach refinements with mentor.

## Reflections:

It was a day of good work — and even better conversations.

First came updates to the dummy hop approach, bringing it very close to
completion. Then came the highlight: refining the currency approach with my
mentor. Building on our earlier discussions and his latest feedback, I was able
to sharpen my understanding and propose a design that moved the conversation
forward.

We left with clear improvements mapped out, including how currency conversion
trait parameterisation should work in practice. And then, the moment that made
my day — a “great work” from my mentor for the design idea of introducing a
single trait function for currency conversion, while leaving all quantity,
amount handling, and verification to the backend.

Small words, big impact. Moments like this are some of the most precious in the
journey.

# Log 22: "Finally!!"

> 18 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Completed the `OffersMessageFlow` branch.

## Reflections:

After more than six hours of work today, Iâ€™m so happy to say that the
`OffersMessageFlow` branch is finally complete! With just a few minor touch-ups,
Iâ€™ll be ready to push it later today.

Iâ€™m incredibly satisfiedâ€”but also too tired to celebrate.  
Note to self: Celebrate tomorrow!

Edit: Here's the
[PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412)! ðŸ¥³

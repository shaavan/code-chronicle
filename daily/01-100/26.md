# Log 26: "Polishing the Details"

> 22 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed feedback and refined the `OffersMessageFlow` branch.
- Expanded the presentation for the upcoming Bitcoin Dev Summit.

## Reflections:

Today, I focused on addressing the feedback my mentor and I discussed earlier
this week. Incorporating those suggestions added a level of finesse that every
final branch deserves. A great set of eyes on your work truly makes a
difference!

I also worked on expanding my presentation to make it a bit more comprehensive
for the discussion. Feeling good about the progress on both fronts!

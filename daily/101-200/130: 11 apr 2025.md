# Log 130: "Listening, Learning, Refining"

> 09 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed
  [feedback](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3728.02) on the
  Dummy Hops PR.

## Reflections:

Today, I focused on incorporating some **very thoughtful and in-depth feedback**
from my peers on the Dummy Hops PR I opened recently.

The comments not only pointed out areas for improvement but also deepened my own
understanding of the design choices I made in the first version. Itâ€™s always
refreshing to see how collaborative review doesnâ€™t just fix issuesâ€”it helps
evolve the idea itself.

After implementing the suggestions, the Dummy Hops logic now feels **cleaner,
better tested, and more practical for real-world use** within the codebase.

Hereâ€™s to refining our work, learning through feedback, and getting better with
every step! ðŸ’¡

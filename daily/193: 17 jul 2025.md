# Log 193: _A Sprint_

> 17 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3917#issuecomment-3084698053)
  the `ReceiveAuthKey` PR based on multiple rounds of peer review

## Reflections:

Today was a sprint — and one that’s still mid-stride.  
PR [#3917], which introduces the new `ReceiveAuthKey` logic, finally caught some
review momentum, thanks to fresh eyes and thoughtful feedback from peers.

I took it as my cue to push.  
Through multiple rounds of updates and refinements, I brought the PR to a
near-final state. The core is now solid, the integration clean, and the end in
sight.

But we’re not done yet.  
There are just a few final tweaks left — and I’m headed right back to the
keyboard to get them through.

A short log, but a meaningful one.  
Sometimes, all you need is the wind behind you — and then, you run. 🏃

# Log 63: "Simplifications & Implementations"

> 08 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Cleaned up
  [#3504](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3504).
- Updated the
  [No Path Offer](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/blinded_api-10)
  approach based on mentor feedback.

## Reflections:

Building on yesterdayâ€™s discussion, I focused on addressing my mentorâ€™s
feedback.

First, I adjusted the visibility of the `get_and_clear_raa_blocker` function,
reducing the number of test-specific declarations needed. Second, I simplified
the `No Path Offer` branch by converting the config parameter to a boolean
(`is_compact`) and introducing a NULL router for cases where no blinded paths
are required. This gave me a deeper understanding of the NULL design pattern and
how to implement it effectively. It was incredibly satisfying to see this
concept in action.

Hereâ€™s to a productive and insightful week ahead! ðŸš€

### Edit:

I also spent time updating the
[currency](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-01)
approach. This time, I implemented two independent traitsâ€”`Bolt12Assessor` and
`CurrencyAssessor`â€”allowing them to function separately.

This separation significantly improves the UX for simpler use cases involving
only currency handling, while also removing the extra burden of implementing
currency handling for users who want to customize `Bolt12Assessor`. It felt
great pushing that extra mile today!

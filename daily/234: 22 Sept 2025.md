# Log 234: The AAD Day

> 22 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Implemented] AAD-based verification for blinded payment paths.

## Reflections

Building on the planning from the weekend, today I stepped into new territory:
implementing the base for dummy hops in blinded **payment** paths.

But before dummy hops could make sense, the first priority was clear—establish
the _right_ style of verification. And that led to something elegant.

Instead of relying on `(HMAC, Nonce)` for per-hop auth, this new approach uses
AAD (Associated Authenticated Data) tied to the **entire** blinded path.  
The result? A cleaner, simpler verification flow that doesn’t authenticate each
packet individually—but rather the path as a whole.

This shift not only simplifies things—it unlocks a powerful property:  
When dummy hops are padded to the same size as real hops (`ForwardTlvs`),
they’re fully masked. Cleanly. Uniformly. No leakage.

It’s still early—currently in draft—but with this first step in, I feel
confident in the direction we’re taking. Dummy hops for payment paths in LDK are
no longer an idea. They’re taking shape—with real security and privacy behind
them.

## What I Worked On

- Pushed further into the experimental developments on [event-model]

## Reflections

With the base structure in place, today’s work ventured into the more abstract
side of the event-model.  
The system now catches incoming invoice requests, lets me manually inspect them,
and respond with currency support enabled.

The next step is preparing invoice events. This is where it gets experimental:
the flow doesn’t natively access the payment mechanism or mark a payment as
abandoned. My current idea is to use wrappers to bridge this gap. The approach
is sound, but it feels slightly off—since it layers over components already used
in both internal and public APIs. Whether this is the right path is exactly what
I need to explore next.

The journey continues.

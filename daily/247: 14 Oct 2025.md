# Log 247: Parsing Complete

> 14 Oct 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Implemented] parsing logic for Dummy Payment Paths.

## Reflections

After a long, focused day — progress in one hand and exhaustion in the other — I
finally completed the parsing logic for dummy payment paths.  
The hops are now properly recognized and parsed, and the next step is to update
the testing framework to bring it up to speed with the new dummy hop behavior.

A good day’s work, and a well-earned rest ahead.

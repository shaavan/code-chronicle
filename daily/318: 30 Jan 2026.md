# Log 318: Closing the Month

> 30 Jan 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Updated] the BOLT11 custom TLVs PR

## Reflections

On this final day of the month, I was able to wrap up two important things.

First, I brought the **BOLT11 custom TLVs** PR to a clean and complete state.
Second, I spent time stepping back and planning the path ahead for the coming
month.

I’m happy with both outcomes. It feels good to close January with clarity — both
on what’s been finished and on what’s coming next.

A short log, after a day of good focus.

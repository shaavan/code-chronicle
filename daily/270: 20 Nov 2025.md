# Log 270: Conditional Nuances

> 20 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] the recurrence draft implementation

## Reflections

After making solid headway on the payment dummy hops and waiting for the review
to land, I shifted my focus back to recurrence. Today was all about tightening
both the logic _and_ the inline commentary in the code.

The highlight was finally implementing the maddeningly intricate chain of
conditional interactions laid out in the recurrence spec for the invoice
request’s recurrence fields. That beast is now tamed.

Next up: bringing the same clarity and structure to the invoice’s own recurrence
fields, and then publishing the branch as a draft for early review. Clean logic,
clean commit, clean conscience. A satisfying day.

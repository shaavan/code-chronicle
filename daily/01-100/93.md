## Reflections:

This weekend, I caught a **bad fever**—shivering under layers of clothes while
others walked around in shorts. It knocked me out, forcing me to take some
much-needed rest.

Today, feeling **well enough to work again**, I decided to **ease back in
gently**—addressing pending suggestions on two of my PRs. It was a slow but
**good start**, and I’m glad I took some time to get meaningful work done.

Now, back to resting and recovering fully. **One step at a time.**

## What I Worked On

- [Began implementing] the "sending recurring payment" flow for recurrence.

## Reflections

Today, I took a refreshing pause from the challenges of payment dummy
implementation and returned to another major frontier of my journey:
**recurrence**.

After wrapping up the [first part] of the flow—_receiving_ recurring payments—the
next step was implementing how to _send_ them.

This side turned out to be more complex and more interesting.  
Unlike receiving, sending requires tracking state ourselves: monitoring time
windows, maintaining payment history, and triggering invoice requests
automatically at the right moments.

That’s where today’s challenge lay—and it felt like solving a dense, logical
puzzle. You try things, test assumptions, and keep refining until finally...
_click._ Voilà.

The puzzle isn’t done yet. But a few pieces fell into place today.  
And so, the journey continues. :)

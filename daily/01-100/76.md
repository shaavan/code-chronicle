# Log 76: "Relaxed Progress"

> 25 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated [#3504](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3504)
  and addressed suggestions.
- Cleaned up the
  [Custom Data](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830) PR
  by refining suggestions and improving the PR description.
- Began reviewing
  [#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378).

## Reflections:

On a relaxed weekend, I took the opportunity to address feedback on one of my
PRs and tidy up the Custom Data PR. Cleaning up suggestions and refining the PR
description felt satisfying, as it brought the branch closer to completion.

Additionally, I started reviewing
[#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378) and made
good progress, planning to complete it tomorrow. It feels good to strike a
balance between productivity and ease on a weekend. A relaxing and fulfilling
day!

# Log 204: Recurrence

> 04 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Studied the [Recurrence Spec PR](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240)

## Reflections:

Today was a quieter day — a day of study.

With most of my active works now in review, I took the opportunity to look ahead
and dive into what might come next. That led me to the Recurrence Spec PR.

I spent the day going through the first half of the proposed changes, carefully
reading the logic, structure, and reasoning behind the design. And as always,
curiosity brought questions — which I’m looking forward to exploring deeper
tomorrow.

A good day of learning. One step further into the future.

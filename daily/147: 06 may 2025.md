# Log 147: "New Beginnings"

> 06 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated Flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2854875109).
- Discussed Flow follow-ups with mentor.

## Reflections:

After finally cleaning up and updating the Flow branch, I took a step back to
reflect on whatâ€™s next. I brought this up in my discussion with my mentor, and
together we mapped out possible directions to build on Flow.

One exciting avenue we identified is the **introduction of currency support and
BOLT12 assessors**, built on top of the new Flow architecture. The idea is to
design a Flow-based event management system that can generate events when the
user opts into manual handling via config. This allows the default synchronous
behavior to remain simpleâ€”**while unlocking powerful asynchronous custom
handling** of BOLT12 messages like invoice requests and invoices.

The sky feels wide for Flow now. Iâ€™m excited to walk this path and see where it
leads. ðŸŒ±

# Log 249: Breakthrough!

## What I Worked On

- [Successfully] implemented the payment dummy hops parsing mechanism.

## Reflections

Finally, after days and weeks of effort — trying again and again, seeking
guidance when needed, and staying persistent when it mattered most — I’ve done
it.  
The **blinded payment hops** approach is complete, and in a way that feels
logically sound and ready for production.

It feels like reaching the peak of a mountain I’ve been climbing for so long.  
And the view from here is beautiful.

I’m grateful today.  
And tonight, I’ll sleep content.

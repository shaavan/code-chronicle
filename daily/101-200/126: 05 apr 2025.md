# Log 126: "Three Threads of Thought"

> 05 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Prepared discussion points for
  [Issue #3669](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3669).
- Studied the recurrence draft in
  [BOLT #1240](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240).
- Updated [`Flow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-12)
  based on latest suggestions.

## Reflections:

Today unfolded across three focused threads of thought.

First, I dug into **Issue #3669**, where Matt proposed building an API outside
of `ChannelManager`â€”one that could take a `ChannelDetails` and a context secret
and output a valid reply path. The idea is sound in intention, but the
implementation path is tricky. Weâ€™re caught between either introducing a new API
that overlaps heavily with the existing one, or altering the current APIâ€”risking
breakage for projects already relying on it. Neither option feels optimal, and
Iâ€™ve jotted down my thoughts to discuss with my mentor next week.

Next, I switched gears to read Rustyâ€™s
[BOLT #1240 PR](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240), which
reintroduces **recurrence in BOLT12 Offers**. It was fascinating to see how a
subtle functional changeâ€”recurrenceâ€”requires deep structural thinking across
spec, logic, and UX. A fulfilling read that reminded me how thoughtful design
reveals itself in the details.

Finally, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the latest **Flow** feedback.
After several rounds of suggestions and refinements, I feel I now have a clear
picture of what this iteration of Flow should look like. Iâ€™m already halfway
through implementing the changesâ€”and honestly, itâ€™s feels good.

A quiet, grounded, and very **constructive Saturday**. Here's to the weekend
continuing with this kind of clarity. ðŸŒ¿

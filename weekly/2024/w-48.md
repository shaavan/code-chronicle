# Week 48: "Momentum and Milestones"

> Week of 25 Nov 2024 - 30 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

This week was a blend of refining previous work, addressing feedback, and
sharing ideas through my presentation. Here’s an overview of the key
achievements:

- **Updating Open PRs**: I revisited and updated two important PRs,
  [`Padding`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177) and
  [`Custom TLVs`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830),
  ensuring they moved closer to completion.

- **Refining `OffersMessageFlow`**: I spent significant time addressing
  feedback, cleaning up the code, and moving relevant functions to their proper
  locations. This culminated in a major update that streamlined the branch and
  brought it closer to submission.

- **BOLT12 Presentation**: The highlight of the week was delivering my
  presentation on BOLT12 at the Bitcoin Dev Summit. I introduced the standard
  Lightning transaction workflow, explained how BOLT12 solves reusability
  challenges, and discussed its privacy enhancements through Blinded Paths.
  Engaging with an interactive audience made the experience even more rewarding.

## Reflections:

This week marked a balance between intense focus and meaningful sharing.
Revisiting my earlier work reminded me of the importance of staying consistent
and refining the foundations I’ve built. The updates to `OffersMessageFlow` were
especially satisfying, demonstrating the value of thorough iteration and
feedback.

The BOLT12 presentation was a milestone in itself. Preparing for it gave me a
chance to reflect on the bigger picture of my work, and presenting it allowed me
to connect with the broader developer community. The engaging discussion at the
end of the talk left me inspired and grateful for the opportunity to share and
learn.

As I wrap up this week, I feel a renewed sense of momentum to carry forward into
the next chapter. Here's to more progress and impactful contributions!

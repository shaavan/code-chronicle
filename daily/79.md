# Log 79: "Optimizing & Exploring"

> 29 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated Padding
  [analysis](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177#discussion_r1934032078).
- Researched and analyzed the Payment Notification system.

## Reflections:

Today started with refining the Padding analysis. We realized that while we were
padding data to round off to the optimal size, the fact that padding itself is
stored introduces a slight size overhead due to its type and length. To account
for this, I reanalyzed the data to determine the most efficient padding
valueâ€”one that minimizes wasted space while maintaining a sufficient buffer.

With that analysis wrapped up, I moved on to the most exciting part of the day:
**diving into the Payment Notification system!** Some initial work had already
been done, so I spent time thoroughly understanding the problem it aims to
solve, identifying the remaining open considerations, and brainstorming
solutions.

It was incredibly engaging to critically analyze an idea from the ground up,
exploring different angles and potential solutions. I genuinely enjoyed this
process, and I can already tellâ€”this is going to be a fun journey ahead! ðŸš€

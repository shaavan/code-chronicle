# Log 269: Eureka!!

> 18 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Solved] all the issues with the Payment Dummy Hops.

## Reflections

Eureka! After weeks of effort, I finally solved every remaining issue with the
Blinded Payment Dummy Hops. This journey has been long, messy, and honestly kind
of perilous—but standing on the other side, I can see how much it taught me.

Crossing this milestone shifted something in me. After working through a problem
this stubborn, fewer things feel truly “unachievable,” both in work and in life.
I’m super happy with how it landed.

Now that the core is done, all that remains is the final bit of cleanup before
preparing the PR for review.

# Log 52: "A Day of Fixes and Fresh Starts"

> 23 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Corrected a small issue in the async approach branch.
- Reanalyzed padding with corrected values.
- Began working on
  [#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320).

## Reflections:

Today was a diverse and productive day, filled with tasks across different
areas.

First, I resolved a small issue in the async branch from yesterday. After
discussing the branch with my mentor, I also identified some valuable upgrades
to improve its usefulness and user experience—something I’m excited to take up
soon!

Additionally, I noticed a slight error in the padding values from my earlier
analysis, so I corrected them and updated my findings accordingly. Lastly, I
started digging into
[#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320),
familiarizing myself with the codebase to prepare for solving the issue.

It was an eventful day, and I’m looking forward to tackling more challenges
tomorrow!

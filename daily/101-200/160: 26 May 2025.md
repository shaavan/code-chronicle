# Log 160: Generalization Achieved

> 26 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Completed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-02) the
  new generalized event model for Flow

## Reflections:

Today was about bringing the event model fully to life. After some focused hours
refining and implementing the generalized structure, I now have a working
version that reflects the design we envisioned.

It feels solid — clean, extensible, and flexible in a way that gives the user
more power without overcomplicating the internals.

Tomorrow, I’ll expand the documentation, write a few supporting tests, and share
it with my mentor for review. But for now, it’s satisfying to pause and
appreciate the shift — from concept to clarity to code.

A good start to the week indeed.

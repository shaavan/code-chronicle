# Log 23: "Refining the Flow"

> 19 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Continued refining the
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3412.02)
  branch and discussed it with my mentor.

## Reflections:

After a week-long journey of creating the
[`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412),
I had a productive discussion about the PR with my mentor today. We identified
some crucial points for improvement, but overall, we agreed that the branch is
heading in the right direction—and that made me so happy to hear!

Moving forward, I’ll address these improvement points tomorrow to make the
branch even better!

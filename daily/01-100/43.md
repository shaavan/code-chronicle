# Log 43: "Laying the Groundwork"

> 12 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Reviewed [#3483](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3483).
- Updated
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3412.09)
  to simplify the `OffersMessageCommons` trait.

## Reflections:

Today, I assessed all the PRs blocked by `OffersMessageFlow` and decided to
focus on [one](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246) that
introduces the ability to create offers and refunds without a blinded path.

After deciding on a cleanup approach, I updated `OffersMessageFlow` to lay the
groundwork for the changes needed in
[#3246](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246). Iâ€™m
excited for a productive day of implementation tomorrow!

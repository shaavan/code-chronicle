# Weekly Log 49: Laying the Groundwork

> 30 Nov – 1 Dec 2025

## Overview

This week marked the beginning of a new chapter in the recurrence project —
transitioning from payee flow completion to designing and implementing the
**payer flow**. Over the course of two focused days, I went from full-system
design to the first round of implementation, laying down the foundational
structures for the payer-side recurrence logic.

The work involved not just greenfield planning, but also revisiting and refining
parts of the previously implemented payee flow to ensure consistency across the
system.

## Highlights

### Payer Flow Design Sprint

- Designed the full payer-side recurrence flow, end-to-end.
- Identified all necessary data structures, planned logical checkpoints, and
  scoped out the commit structure for implementation.
- Focused on modeling stages of interaction, from offer interpretation to
  invoice request generation.

### Implementation Kickoff

- Implemented the core data structures for the payer flow.
- Revisited parts of the payee implementation and updated fields to ensure
  structural consistency and forward compatibility.
- Experimented with flow boundaries and naming patterns to better align
  payer/payee responsibilities.

## Reflections

The design sprint was a rewarding challenge — taking the full system from
abstract concept to a concrete build plan in a single day. While implementation
naturally started with a bit of inertia, it was satisfying to resolve structural
conflicts early by proactively retconning the payee flow.

By the end of this brief window, the groundwork has been laid. With the data
structures now in place and the plan clearly scoped, I’m well-positioned to move
into the full payer logic next week.

This was a short but meaningful push — the kind that clears the path for faster
progress ahead.

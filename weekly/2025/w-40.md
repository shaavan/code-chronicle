# Weekly Log 40: Flow, Puzzles, and Milestones

> 27 – 30 September 2025

## Overview

This week was short but packed with forward motion.  
I spent it alternating between two major frontiers—dummy hops for blinded
payment paths and recurrence—making meaningful progress on both.

What stood out wasn’t just the technical steps, but the _state of mind_: deep
flow, puzzle-solving clarity, and the quiet satisfaction of edging closer to
milestones that matter.

## Highlights

- **Dummy Hops (Payment Paths)**

  - [Progressed] significantly, including a deep focus day that produced 350
    lines of working code.
  - Implemented parsing and creation logic—setting the stage for full end-to-end
    testing.

- **Recurrence**

  - [Began implementing] the sending flow, tackling the challenge of automatic triggers
    and payment history tracking.
  - Explored design puzzles that felt like solving elegant, layered
    problems—chasing those rare _voilà_ moments.

- **Milestones**
  - Set a personal goal of logging the dummy hops PR before month’s end—testing
    and polish are next.

## Reflections

What defines this week for me is a sense of **ease in momentum**. Some days
brought sheer output, others the slow unraveling of intricate puzzles.

Together, they pointed in the same direction: building systems that are not just
functional, but internally elegant.

And with testing on the horizon, October promises to begin with something
tangible to show.

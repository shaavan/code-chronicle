## What I Worked On

- [Fixed] another layer of Payment Dummy Hops

## Reflections

I feel so good about my work today. One of those days where everything goes as
expected—you push your hardest and get a solid result. The best kind of day.

Today’s goal was clear: fix the trickiest of the errors with the payment dummy
hops, make the solution production-ready, clearly document the reasoning and
progress, build on advice from the seniors, and keep them in the loop on the
path ahead. A lot of moving parts, but a single center: get the payment dummy
hops truly ready for the world.

And I feel great—not only did I make progress on all fronts, I actually finished
them. Ticked them off with beautiful greens instead of the usual
"to-be-finished" yellows. A great end to a week-long journey, full of learning,
momentum, and quiet triumph.

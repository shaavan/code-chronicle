# Log 118: "Flow, Discussion, and a New Thing"

> 25 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Reviewed [#3677](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3677).
- Discussed Flow approach limitations and potential improvements with my mentor.
- Began exploring [BOLT PR #1240](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240).

## Reflections:

Today was a productive follow-up to the planning and prioritization I did
yesterday!

I began by reviewing
[#3677](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3677), a PR aimed
at enabling the construction of `BlindedPath` from pre-serialized data. After
going through it thoroughly, I suggested improvements to help move it closer to
merge-readiness.

Next, I revisited the latest comments and suggestions from Matt on the Flow PR.
His feedback was insightful, but also raised a few new questionsâ€”which I was
glad to explore in depth during todayâ€™s discussion with my mentor. We talked
through the challenges and clarified next steps. Feeling much clearer now about
the direction Flow should take.

To close out the day, I turned to something fresh and exciting:
[BOLT PR #1240](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240), which proposes
reintroducing offer recurrence in BOLT12. The initial draft is quite intriguing,
and Iâ€™m excited to dig deeper into it tomorrowâ€”with an engineerâ€™s eye for both
detail and potential!

It feels good to keep the momentum going ðŸš€

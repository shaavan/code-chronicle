# Weekly Log 27: _From Closure to Continuation_

> Week of 30 June – 04 July 2025

## Highlights:

- Finalised and closed the
  [No Blinded Path Offer](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246#issuecomment-3023773208)
  PR after addressing final review feedback
- Studied the cryptographic approach in
  [#3845](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3845) —
  including ChaCha20, Poly1305, and AAD concepts — to prepare for further
  development
- Began implementing the remaining pieces of
  [#3845](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/3845-mac), including
  replacing hardcoded keys with user-configurable key sources
- Recovered from a longer-than-expected seasonal flu and picked momentum back up
  with hands-on code contributions and system-level thinking
- Discussed future directions for the event model, particularly on asynchronous
  currency resolution and extending the type-safe flow

## Reflections:

This week marked the close of one long arc — and the start of another.

After weeks of incremental progress, review cycles, and careful improvements,
the _No Blinded Path Offer_ PR finally reached its end. With a clean final
polish and a few well-placed refinements, it was satisfying to wrap it up — not
just functionally, but poetically. The branch felt complete.

From there, I pivoted into the cryptographic heart of the protocol — [#3845],
which proposes a more elegant, space-efficient authentication layer for onion
messages using Poly1305. While cryptography often feels intimidating from the
outside, diving in with intent reminded me: **every complex system is just
layers of understandable ideas, waiting to be patiently unwrapped**.

Midweek, I hit a pause. A bout of flu slowed things down, and the body demanded
rest. But there’s beauty in resuming — in returning to code not out of pressure,
but out of joy. Friday, I picked up where I left off, introducing configurable
key logic and preparing to integrate it cleanly with dummy hop TLVs. It felt
like reclaiming rhythm — not rushing it, but meeting it halfway.

This was a week of **reentry and readiness**. One chapter closed. Another
opened. And through it all, a quiet reaffirmation: _Even when the pace pauses,
the path continues._

# Log 165: A Day of Victory!!

> 02 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finished and merged
  [`Flow`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639) ðŸŽ‰
- [Implemented](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/dummy-13) the
  new Dummy Hops approach

## Reflections:

**Finally.** After weeks of effort â€” writing, rewriting, refining, discussing,
debugging â€” Flow is now merged!

Itâ€™s hard to describe how satisfying it feels to close this chapter. There were
moments of clarity, moments of confusion, moments of relentless persistence. But
in the end, it all came together. The Flow PR is no longer just an idea, or a
work-in-progress â€” itâ€™s now part of the codebase. What a journey. What a day.

And as if that werenâ€™t enough â€” I also cracked the Dummy Hops problem that had
been puzzling me for the last few days. The new approach worked, cleanly and
elegantly.

A true day of celebration.  
A day of victory. ðŸ™Œ

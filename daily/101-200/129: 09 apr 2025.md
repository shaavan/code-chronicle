# Log 129: "Here Come Dummies!"

> 09 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Opened PR introducing **Dummy Hops** in Blinded Paths:  
  [#3726](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726)

## Reflections:

**Finally!** After a long haul filled with brainstorming, iterations, and
incredibly helpful discussions with peers, I was able to **get the Dummy Hops PR
out**.

This PR introduces the ability to **add dummy hops to any blinded message
path**â€”a subtle but powerful enhancement. When a node receives a blinded
message, these dummy hops will now be **systematically decoded until the final
`ReceiveTlvs`** is reached.

The biggest challenge this PR addresses is around **timing-based deanonymization
attacks**. By allowing dummy hops to precede the actual final recipient, it
becomes **infeasible to guess the recipient based on response timing**â€”a big win
for privacy and robustness.

It took time to arrive at the right design, but the effort paid off.  
**Feeling proud** of getting this done and excited to see it move forward in
review. A good day indeed! ðŸš€

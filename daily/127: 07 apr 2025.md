# Log 127: "Build. Discuss. Advance"

> 07 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated [`Flow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3639.04),
  refining the trait and `OffersMessageFlow`.
- Discussed Dummy Hops implementation challenges and potential approaches with a
  senior.

## Reflections:

Today was a day of both **implementation and learning**.

First, I continued refining the `Flow` branch. The core update involved
expanding `OffersMessageFlow` to be parameterized over both `MessageRouter` and
`Router`, making it self-sufficient in generating its own blinded
paths—**without needing the caller to inject a custom closure**. With this
shift, the `Flow` trait and its implementation feel **cleaner, more complete**,
and closer to being review-ready.

I also began mapping out the remaining parts of the `OffersMessageFlow`
work—particularly how we'll support **custom assessors (e.g., currency logic)**
and **asynchronous usage**. These seem best addressed in a follow-up PR, and I
plan to bring this into upcoming discussions with the team.

On the **Dummy Hops** front, I revisited the problem and clearly articulated the
core obstacle. After clarifying the challenge, I had a productive discussion
with a senior engineer who’s familiar with that section of the codebase. The
conversation gave me valuable insights to explore further.

All in all, I made meaningful progress on two major threads today. Now, I’m
looking forward to carrying this momentum into the days ahead!

# Log 24: "Preparing for the Bitcoin Dev Summit"

> 20 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Worked on preparing my presentation for the upcoming Bitcoin Dev Summit.

## Reflections:

Taking a break from `OffersMessageFlow`, I focused on preparing my presentation
for the upcoming Bitcoin Dev Summit. This week-long event will feature
hackathons, talks, and discussions with some of the best Bitcoin developers in
the country.

I’ll be giving a talk on BOLT12, highlighting its importance and the problems it
addresses in the Lightning Network. This is going to be a fun and exciting week!

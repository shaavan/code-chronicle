# Log 329: Returning With Fresh Eyes

> 20 Feb 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Solved] the remaining test failures in the dummy hops follow-up

## Reflections

Today, after a long gap, I returned to the dummy hops PR.

The last time I touched this work, it was blocked on two test failures that felt
stubborn and opaque. Coming back to them with fresh eyes made a real difference
— once I dropped the earlier assumptions, the failures started to make sense.

The first issue turned out to be a missing accounting of the additional CLTV
delta introduced by dummy hops. The second failure exposed a more subtle blind
spot in the dummy hops implementation itself, which led to a necessary fix.

With those resolved, the core of the dummy hops follow-up is now complete. What
remains is cleanup: polishing the implementation, formalizing documentation and
commits, and adding user-facing getters and setters for dummy hop fees.

A satisfying return — and a clean path to finishing the work.

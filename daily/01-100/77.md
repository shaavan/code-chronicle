# Log 77: "Shaping the Future"

> 27 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Worked on finalizing the proposal for next year.

## Reflections:

Today was dedicated to crafting the proposal for next year, centered around a
new core spec: the "Payment Notification System." This project will be a
collaborative effort with my mentor, and I’m excited about the potential it
holds for enhancing the Lightning Network.

The proposal is coming together beautifully, and I have high hopes for what
we’ll achieve in the coming year. It feels invigorating to lay the groundwork
for meaningful contributions ahead!

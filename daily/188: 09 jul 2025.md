# Log 188: _Striking the Final Chord_

> 09 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finalized the
  [No Blinded Path Offer](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246#issuecomment-3052752962)
  PR
- [Updated](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3917#issuecomment-3053218956)
  the `ReceiveAuthKey` PR by removing all redundant `(hmac, nonce)` fields from
  the codebase

## Reflections:

Today marked the official closure of the _No Blinded Path Offer_ journey. With
the final batch of test updates now merged, the branch is complete — a
satisfying end to a long arc of iterative refinement, review, and persistence.

With that chapter closed, I turned my focus to the `ReceiveAuthKey` PR. My main
task today was to sweep through the codebase and remove every last instance of
the now-redundant `(hmac, nonce)` authentication — a deep cleanup that not only
lightened the code but also streamlined the structure around `MessageContext`.

Tomorrow’s goal is to push this PR across the finish line, so I can move forward
with applying this model to dummy hops and complete the cycle. Steady steps —
and onward we go.

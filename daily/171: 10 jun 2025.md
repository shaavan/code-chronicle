# Log 171: _Cleaning Up_

> 10 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726#issuecomment-2959247025)
  the Dummy Hops implementation

## Reflections:

Today was a day of **cleaning up** — in more ways than one.

It began with polishing the Dummy Hops work I completed yesterday. That meant
cleaning up the code, tightening the logic, and refining the documentation to
get it update-ready. Once that was in place, I turned my attention to the bigger
picture.

I spent time revisiting my open branches — surveying their current states,
replying to outstanding comments, and keeping the flow of conversation alive. It
was a quiet rhythm of checking in, organizing, and re-aligning.

Finally, there was the inner cleanup: taking a step back to reprioritize, to
reflect on what’s essential, and to clear mental clutter. That part wasn’t in
code, but in clarity.

And with that, the mind feels still again — the path ahead, a little more
visible.

Cleaned up. Inside and out.

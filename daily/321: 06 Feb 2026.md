## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on the currency implementation

## Reflections

After yesterday’s architectural breakthrough, today was about turning the idea
into concrete movement.

I focused on three main fronts.

First, extending `Invoice` and `InvoiceRequest` to correctly interpret the
underlying Offer’s amount. Since the resolved value now originates at the
source, these layers need to consume it cleanly without reintroducing conversion
awareness downstream.

Second, thinking carefully about _where_ the conversion responsibility should
live. Should the public API automatically interpret the amount for the user? Or
should the onus remain explicit, requiring users to call `interpret_amount`
themselves before proceeding? That boundary matters — it shapes both ergonomics
and clarity of ownership.

Third, experimenting with allowing LDK to create Offers denominated in currency
directly. This adds another dimension to the design and forces the conversion
model to prove its consistency.

It was one of those days where progress isn’t flashy, but structural. The pieces
are starting to align.

Tomorrow is about tightening the edges and bringing the implementation closer to
completion.

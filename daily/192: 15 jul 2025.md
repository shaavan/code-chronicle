# Log 192: _Welcome Back, Asynchronicity_

> 15 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Expanded](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-18) the
  `CurrencyConversion` trait to support asynchronous flows as well

## Reflections:

Today, after wrapping up the synchronous `CurrencyConversion` design, I walked
through it with my mentor.  
The approach was simple and clean — let the user provide a conversion function,
and everything else flows from there.

But then came a gentle nudge of wisdom.  
What if, he said, we allowed users to manually call the builder functions too —
passing their custom currency conversion logic when needed? That would give us a
graceful way to support _both_ synchronous and asynchronous handling.

That small suggestion opened a new door.  
By the end of the day, the updated model now supports all three modes:

- Default synchronous behavior
- Manual synchronous handling
- Fully asynchronous integration

And in doing so, it circled back to something I’ve been learning again and
again:  
Sometimes, choosing one path with conviction is the only way to eventually hold
both.  
And sometimes, just one thoughtful voice can help you see the broader horizon
hidden within your current map.

A beautifully complete day — both in thought and code.

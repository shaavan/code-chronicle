# Log 149: "An Investigation Begins"

> 09 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Located a new test failure while addressing Flow
  [suggestions](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#discussion_r2075827495).

## Reflections:

After addressing the last of the Flow comments, I stumbled upon something
curious. As soon as I updated the code to move `payment_hash` and
`payment_secret` creation into Flow, a completely unrelated
test—[`end_to_end_test`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/78fee88a27709848078e9b4b187ce4341808cd0c/lightning-dns-resolver/src/lib.rs#L368)—started
failing.

Much like the previous Flow bug, this test shouldn't be impacted by the change…
and yet, it is.

I spent some time today debugging it, but ran into a roadblock. I plan to dive
deeper tomorrow, and in the meantime, I've shared my findings with peers to get
their take as well.

I’m glad to have caught this early—and excited to get to the bottom of it.
Another mystery in the making. 🔍

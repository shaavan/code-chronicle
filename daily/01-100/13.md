# Log 13: "OffersMessageFlow Correction"

> 08 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Continued work on `OffersMessageFlow` to enable proper integration, message
  functioning and test behavior.

## Reflections:

`OffersMessageFlow` is the most fun and complex project I’ve taken on in a
while. After solving the lifetime issues, I took another shot at progressing,
but it seems messages still aren’t processing correctly.

Next up: fixing message processing and refining the test framework. Once that’s
done, I’ll be ready to open the first full draft of this branch. This is going
to be so interesting!

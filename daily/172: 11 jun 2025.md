# Log 172: _A Day of Beautiful Learnings_

> 11 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Discussed improvements to Dummy Hops, the Flow Event Model, and the No-Path
  Offer approach

## Reflections:

Today was a day of meaningful discussions — clearing out priorities, surfacing
edge cases, and refining the vision for what’s next.

I walked away with several valuable insights.

First, while our current Dummy Hops approach — with authentication applied only
to the first hop — is a significant improvement, we haven’t yet reached **full
anonymization**. An authenticated dummy hop still stands out in size, even when
padded, compared to a standard `ForwardTlv`. That’s something we’ll need to
address before we can consider the design truly complete.

Second, the **Flow event model** is now well-grounded and nearing its final
form. But a few refinements remain — like optimizing how `amount_source` is
derived during parsing. If we can extract it early (during `InvoiceRequest` or
`Invoice` decoding), we avoid a second round of logic later in the flow.
Cleaner, leaner, smarter.

Lastly, the **No-Path Offer** approach is now accepted and in place — with just
one tweak: by default, we’ll use **compact blinded paths** instead of
full-length ones. As
[we reasoned](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246#pullrequestreview-2898070836),
it’s the more practical and elegant solution.

Today was not about pushing code — it was about deepening clarity.  
And that, too, is real progress.

A day of beautiful learnings indeed.

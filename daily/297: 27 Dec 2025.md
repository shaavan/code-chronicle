# Log 297: Signed and Sealed

> 27 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Finished] introducing the explicit signing mechanism in the payer flow

## Reflections

Today, after another focused sprint to close out the week, I finally finished
introducing an explicit payer signing public key — and ensured consistent
signing across recurrence sessions.

Getting here took a fair amount of back-and-forth between the original roadmap
and previously implemented pieces. The change touched more of the system than
expected: outbound recurrence session data, offer payers, recurrence payers, and
invoice handling all needed updates to align with the new signing flow.

But after working through those layers and reconciling the earlier assumptions,
everything finally clicked into place. The payer flow now has a clear and
consistent signing story for recurrence.

With that milestone behind me, I’m happy to call this a wrap for the week — and
take a well-earned weekend’s rest.

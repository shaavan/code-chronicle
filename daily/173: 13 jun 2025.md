> 13 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated
  [`DummyTlvs`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726#issuecomment-2966701804)
  after Flow merge
- Addressed suggestions for
  [`Offer with No Blinded Path`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/blinded_api-16)

## Reflections:

Today was a day of catching up and realigning after the merge of
`OffersMessageFlow`. Since many of my branches touched overlapping areas, the
merge introduced the need for **significant rebasing and adjustments** across my
open PRs.

First, I updated the DummyTlvs branch. The rebase took time, but the process
itself was smooth — a gentle return to consistency.

Next, I moved on to the “Offer with No Blinded Path” branch. As per our new
default, compact blinded paths are now used unless the user opts into
full-length paths through a custom router. It’s a clean, flexible approach — but
while implementing it, I ran into an interesting problem.

With tests now using compact paths by default, one test began failing: it
couldn’t resolve the **introduction node** when compact paths were involved. The
challenge now is to patch this in a way that feels native — making sure the test
can resolve what it needs without adding unnecessary complexity or bloating the
test logic.

So that’s tomorrow’s puzzle: a clean fix, with minimal disruption.  
For now, a solid day of thoughtful updates.

Onward we go.

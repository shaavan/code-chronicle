# Log 85: "Flow"

> 06 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3412.14).
- Planned a structured approach for future `OffersMessageFlow` updates.

## Reflections:

Today, I **addressed all the suggestions** from my recent discussion with my
mentor about `Flow`. Once I had implemented the changes, I took a step back and
**noticed how unstructured the `Flow` had become over time**. With multiple
updates layered on top of each other, the changes lacked a clear progression,
making future refinements harder to manage.

So, I **sat down to map out the best approach for structuring future updates**.
The goal:

- Ensure each change logically builds upon the previous one.
- Avoid unnecessary backtracking or repeated steps between commits.
- Maintain a **clean, progressive update path** for better readability and
  maintainability.

I think Iâ€™ve found the **Goldilocks zone**â€”a structured, balanced way to refine
`Flow` while keeping it intuitive and modular. Now, the focus shifts to
**executing this vision**, presenting a much cleaner `Flow` to the world.

**Stay tuned!** ðŸš€

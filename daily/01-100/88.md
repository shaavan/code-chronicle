## Reflections:

Finally, a journey taken, a mountain captured, a victory earned. I was able to
take a break from yesterday effort, and look the rebasing with fresh sets of
eyes. And finally it clicked, and in the moment the light was shined in the
darkness, and the veil was lifted, and the troubles of yesterday vanished in an
instant. For a brief second, both darkness and light stood together, revealing
what makes this journey so beautiful.

# Log 266: A Shift in the Wind

> 14 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Updated] pay-dummy.

## Reflections

After days of pushing against the same set of problems, today finally brought
real movement.  
The first shift was internal: realizing that to make progress, I had to get the
work I had so far _out_ and ask for help. So I pushed the update, documented the
bottlenecks clearly, and reached out.

That alone cleared half the fog.

My senior colleague offered a sharp insight on the overpaying issue, and while
investigating it, I discovered something unexpected:  
the failure wasn’t caused by dummy hops at all — I had simply tripped over an
existing LDK quirk.

Overpaying on the payer-as-intro-node path is already a known tradeoff in LDK.
Fixing it requires complex inverse fee math for blinded paths, and even then the
margin for error is razor-thin. LDK chooses the simpler, safer option: accept
slight overpaying instead of risking routine payment failures.

That realization took one “problem” off the table entirely.

Now only the final real challenge remains — the shared-secret mismatch.  
And with the fog cleared, I’m hopeful I can make decisive progress on it
tomorrow.

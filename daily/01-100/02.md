# Log 02: "Brainstorming & Understanding Procedural Macros"

> 24 Oct 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Brainstormed a new approach for
  [#3246](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246), shifting
  the responsibility for Blinded Path properties to `MessageRouter`. Because,
  "the Router must decide, a Blinded Path Type ðŸŽ¶".
- Took a first dive into
  [#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378).
  Procedural macros are new territory for me, and Iâ€™m excited to explore them.

## Reflections:

Today reminded me that brainstorming and proper planning are the first half of a
successful project. Figuring things out early has really set me up to tackle the
problem head-on tomorrow!  
I also learned that proc macros are complex (xD), but theyâ€™re incredibly
powerful. With the code introduced in
[#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378), weâ€™ll
avoid manually handling serialization/deserialization of outdated fields!
Procedural macros feel like magic to me, and tomorrow Iâ€™ll try to unlock that
magic for myself! ðŸª„

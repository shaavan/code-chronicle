# Log 280: Steady Progress

> 03 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Introduced] recurrence support for invoice creation in the payer flow
- [Addressed] reviewer suggestions for dummy hops

## Reflections

Today was a day of progress on two fronts.

First, I made a clear step toward completing the **payer flow** by introducing
support for initializing recurrence fields in the invoice request — based on the
corresponding recurrent offer.

Second, I revisited the **dummy hops** work and addressed outstanding reviewer
suggestions to keep it clean and up to date.

Not a flashy day, but a solid one. The path forward is clearer on both sides.

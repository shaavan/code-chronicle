# Log 57: "Final Touches of the Year"

> 31 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated the
  [No Path Offer](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/blinded_api-9)
  approach, cleaning up the branch by removing redundant blinded path creation
  functions.

## Reflections:

Today, following a discussion with my mentor, I focused on cleaning up the
[branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/blinded_api-9) by
removing redundant blinded path creation function variants. To achieve this, I
made a subtle but impactful change: updating the default
`create_{offer, refund}_builder` to generate blinded paths using the router
parameterized with the flow.

This change makes a lot of senseâ€”it keeps the default behavior simple and
intuitive while allowing users to create offers with blinded paths using the
default setup. For more customized behavior, users can still utilize the
specialized functions as needed.

The result is a more intuitive and cleaner user interface that also retains
flexibility for custom implementations.

Happy to have completed another task before the year closes. Saying goodbye to
this beautiful day and wrapping up the year with this final log. Hereâ€™s to an
even better year ahead! ðŸŽ‰

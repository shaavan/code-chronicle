# Log 46: "A Productive Return"

> 16 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated `OffersMessageFlow` and `No Path Offer` branches.
- Worked on the approach for reintroducing asynchronous BOLT12 message support.

## Reflections:

After a long weekend, I shifted focus to perfecting the approach for
reintroducing asynchronous BOLT12 message support in
[#3318](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3318).

The approach involves introducing a new trait that users can implement to define
how they want to handle onion messages asynchronously. Meanwhile, a default
implementation will wrap the message handling in the same way as the synchronous
case.

The progress so far looks promising, and Iâ€™m optimistic about finishing it
tomorrow. Fingers crossed! ðŸŒŸ

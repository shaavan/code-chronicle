# Log 50: "Perfecting the Approach"

> 22 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Finished the currency handling and async BOLT12 handling approach
  ([invreqevent-9](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-9)).

## Reflections:

Carving out some quality time this weekend, I focused on perfecting the async
BOLT12 handling approach, building on the
[previous version](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-8)
of the branch.

I expanded the approach to handle cases where the `invoice_request` is missing
the amount, and where an invoice is sent for an offer represented in a specific
currency while the corresponding `invoice_request` doesnâ€™t specify the amount.

It felt great to finish up this branch just before the sun set on the week. A
satisfying way to round things off!

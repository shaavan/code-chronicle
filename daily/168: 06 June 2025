# Log 168: *Chiseling The Beauty*

> 06 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Refined and [finished](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-05) the Flow event model

## Reflections:

Today was all about **polishing** — taking the Flow event model and refining it to a point of clarity so crisp, both in documentation and code, that its purpose shines through without needing explanation.

I wanted the intent to be self-evident. The structure to feel natural. The additions to sit in the codebase like they had always belonged.

And I’m proud to say — I gave it my all.

There was a moment today where I felt, in my own quiet way, a little like Michelangelo must have when he said:

> *“I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.”*

That’s what this day felt like — carving out the essence.
A day of bringing out the beauty.

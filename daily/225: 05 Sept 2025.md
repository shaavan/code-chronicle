# Log 225: Webs of Relations

> 05 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Continued] progress with PoC implementation of [recurrence].

## Reflections

With all the fields for offers, invoice requests, and invoices now introduced,
and their serialization issues resolved. Today was about weaving them together.

The goal was to define the relationships between them. For instance:  
**Recurrence period = invoice basetime + (period number × recurrence time period
length)**  
spread across three different layers of data.

Unraveling this logic felt like decoding a temporal equation stitched across the
codebase. I made good progress mapping these relationships, though there are
still a few knots left to untangle.

Tomorrow, I’ll keep pushing to tie those threads together. A working prototype
is in sight now, and I’m excited to see it come to life.

Let’s do it!

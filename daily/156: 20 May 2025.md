# Log 156: _Finishing the Flow, Planting Currency_

> 20 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finalized remaining updates for `Flow`
- Refined the `Currency` event model after discussions with my mentor

## Reflections:

The first half of the day was spent closing out the final changes for Flow. It
feels both triumphant and slightly melancholic — like finishing the last chapter
of a book that took months to write. Flow was a massive arc in this journey, and
seeing it come to its conclusion feels surreal.

Once that was wrapped up, I turned my attention back to the future: refining the
Currency model.

A key conversation with my mentor helped clarify something important — that
`Refund`s are essentially a special type of `InvoiceRequest`, and as such,
they’re always denominated in Bitcoin, not fiat. That insight helped clean up
the logic and scope of the model significantly.

We then discussed the event-handling design and the key decision points around
how and when these currency events should surface to the user. It’s one of those
architectural choices that could shape future extensibility — so it felt good to
pause, reflect, and align on direction.

All in all, a fulfilling day. Deep work, meaningful guidance, and clarity
gained.

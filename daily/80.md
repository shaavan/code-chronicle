# Log 80: "Small Moments, Big Impact"

> 31 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3177.30) the
  Padding PR based on analysis feedback.
- Reviewed [#3576](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3576).

## Reflections:

After refining the padding analysis and getting feedback on the most optimal
values, I updated the **Padding PR**. I now feel confident that it’s complete
and should be merged soon.

I also reviewed another PR that introduced **rustfmt changes** across multiple
files. During the review, a colleague pointed out that this PR might conflict
with mine and suggested pausing their update to avoid causing extra work for me.
That small moment of consideration meant a lot—it reminded me that I’m part of a
team that looks out for each other.

I assured them that I could handle the refactor and that keeping the files clean
was the priority. It was a simple interaction, but it reinforced the power of
**thoughtfulness in collaboration**. Small moments like these make the journey
even more fulfilling.

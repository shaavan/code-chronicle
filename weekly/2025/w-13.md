# Week 13: "Momentum, Mindset, and Meaningful Work"

> Week of 22 March 2025 â€“ 28 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **Tackled New Issue:
  [#3043](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3043)**  
  Explored the idea of introducing a new `UserConfig` to bypass certain
  dust/feerate checks in trusted LSP setups. This involved understanding the
  trade-offs between LDK's conservative defaults and real-world usage patterns
  with trusted peers.

- **Reviewed
  [#3680](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3680) and
  [#3674](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3674)**  
  Dived deep into the intricacies of multi-threaded channel state handling and
  provided suggestions to improve clarity and logic flow, especially around HTLC
  preimage management.

- **Refined Offers Flow Design**  
  Held a detailed discussion with my mentor about current limitations in the
  `OffersMessageFlow` trait and explored ideas to remove MessageRouter
  responsibility while retaining orchestrated flow behavior.

- **Started Exploring BOLT PR
  [#1240](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240)**  
  Began understanding the new draft proposal around Offer Recurrence being
  reintroduced in BOLT12. Looking at it both from protocol and implementation
  perspectives.

- **Prepared and Finalized My Bitcoin Summit Presentation**  
  Spent the week slowly crafting the base, visuals, and final touches of my
  upcoming talk. Wrapped it all up during travel and in between workshop
  sessions.

- **Summit Participation & Learning**  
  Attended multiple workshops at the Bitcoin Summit, exploring exciting ideas
  from privacy-first Bitcoin adoption to new updates in the protocol layer.
  These sessions sparked lots of curiosity and insight.

- **CI & Cleanup Work**  
  Updated CI and made final refinements to the `No Path Offer` PR, bringing it
  up to shape post-refactor.

## Reflections:

This week was a **harmonious blend of exploration and execution**. From pushing
forward new issues to stepping back and thinking strategically about `Flow`
design, the rhythm of the week felt both grounded and expansive.

The summit offered a shift in environmentâ€”rich in learning, conversations, and
quiet reflection. It felt like a **beautiful convergence of contribution and
connection**, and even in between all the excitement, I carved out moments to
tie up loose ends and polish what needed attention.

What stood out this week wasnâ€™t just the volume of tasks completed, but the
**deep presence in each activity**â€”whether reviewing a thread-heavy PR or
sipping tea while outlining presentation slides under open skies.

Hereâ€™s to building, learning, and showing up with clarity, again and again. ðŸš€

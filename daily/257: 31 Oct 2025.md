# Log 257: Deeper Still

> 31 Oct 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on solving the third issue for **Payment Dummy Hops**.

## Reflections

The journey went a layer deeper today.  
After finding the cause of yesterday’s keysend error, I dove back in — and
discovered the root of the new issue: because of dummy hops, a node that should
have been treated as _non-final_ is being interpreted as _final_.

It’s another piece of the puzzle, and there are still a few layers left to peel
before I can bring this one to a close.

Just leaving a quick log here before diving back into the code.

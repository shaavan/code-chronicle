# Week 08: "Momentum & Milestones"

> Week of 18 Feb 2025 â€“ 22 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was about **recovering, regaining momentum, and making meaningful
progress** across multiple PRs. Despite starting slow after an illness, I was
able to **build back up** and get some significant work done.

- **Updated `RouteParametersConfig`**
  ([PR](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3342.12))

  - Addressed suggestions and refinements to bring it closer to merging.

- **Worked on `Custom Data` Rebase & Fixes**
  ([Branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/custom_tlvs-16))

  - Fixed merge conflicts and updated the implementation.

- **Dived into the `Payment Notification` system**

  - Explored considerations and planned next steps.

- **Started working on `RouteParametersConfig Part-2`**
  ([Branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/i3262b-1))
  - Began designing configurability for **BOLT11** similar to what was
    introduced for BOLT12.

## Reflections:

This week started as a **gentle walk** as I recovered from illness, but soon
turned into a **light jog**, and by the end, I was back at **full speed**. I
managed to rebase and refine my existing PRs, **address critical feedback**, and
even **kickstart new work** on `RouteParametersConfig Part-2`.

Mapping out the **BOLT11 expansion** was particularly excitingâ€”it reminded me of
how each step **builds on the previous one**, shaping the bigger picture.

Itâ€™s been a week of **momentum and milestones**, and Iâ€™m **looking forward to
pushing things even further next week!** ðŸš€

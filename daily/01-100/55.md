# Log 55: "Expanding Traits"

> 26 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Expanded the `Bolt12Assessor` trait in the
  [assessor branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-10).

## Reflections:

Building on where I left off yesterday, I addressed another suggestion from my
discussion with my mentor.

I expanded the `Bolt12Assessor` trait to introduce greater flexibility in
handling currency. This allows users to implement specific currency support
while also enabling them to generally assess received `InvoiceRequest` and
`Invoice` messages if they want to, before sending a reply.

The updated approach makes the system cleaner, easier to reason about, and
improves user experience overall. It felt great to add another meaningful block
to the journey of building the Assessor!

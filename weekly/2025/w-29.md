# Weekly Log 29: _From Flow to Finish Lines_

> Week of 13 July – 17 July 2025

## Highlights:

- Finalized the
  [CurrencyConversion](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-17)
  trait-based design for handling currency units in Flow's event model
- Expanded the approach to support both synchronous and asynchronous use-cases,
  enabling flexibility for different LDK integrations  
  ([currency-18](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-18))
- Had an insightful design discussion with mentor — leading to a cleaner model
  that supports both automated and manual event generation flows
- Progressed
  [PR #3917](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3917) by
  addressing peer feedback and conducting multiple update rounds
- Nearly finalized the ReceiveAuthKey logic — replacing redundant
  `(hmac, nonce)` fields across the codebase

## Reflections:

This week was a blend of focused deep work and energetic iteration — moving
between moments of still design and bursts of execution.

It began with clarity: wrapping up the synchronous trait-based
CurrencyConversion system. A clean design emerged — one where the user needs
only to implement a simple conversion trait, and the system takes care of the
rest. But clarity deepened with collaboration. A conversation with my mentor
nudged the design forward: what if we could support not just default automation,
but also manual flows and asynchronous conversions? That idea reframed the
architecture — and by midweek, we had a system that was truly flexible.

In parallel, the long-running PR #3917 picked up review momentum. And with it, I
entered a sprint — tackling feedback, revisiting design details, and bringing
the patch closer to the finish line. While the PR isn’t merged just yet, the end
is clearly in sight.

If last week was about polish, this one was about **synchronicity** — of
systems, design intents, and timing. Choosing one direction early gave me the
clarity to eventually fold in all others. And sometimes, that’s the secret: move
with purpose, then allow for integration.

A good week of flow, friction, and forward motion.

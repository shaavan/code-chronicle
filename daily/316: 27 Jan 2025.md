# Log 316: Back to the Future

> 27 Jan 2026

## What I Worked On

- Worked on the proposal for the coming year

## Reflections

Today was about stepping back from the present and looking toward the future —
specifically, working on the proposal for the year ahead.

I started with a few simple ideas: how I could build on my current projects, and
what kinds of problems I might want to tackle in the coming months. As I worked
through them, I was pleasantly surprised to see those rough thoughts evolve into
a coherent and compelling narrative.

It feels good to see a clear direction begin to take shape. I’m looking forward
to returning to this proposal, refining it further, and seeing what it becomes
once it’s finished.

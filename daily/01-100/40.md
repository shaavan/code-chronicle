# Log 40: "Building on Reviews"

> 9 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Reviewed [#3435](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3435)
  and [#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378).

## Reflections:

Keeping the review momentum going, I tackled another two PRs today.

[One](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3435) introduces an
authentication mechanism for Blinded Payment Paths, while the
[other](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378) addresses
the need for manual handling of legacy fields. These PRs are especially
important since they need to be merged before I can build further on two of my
own PRs ([#3342](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342)
and [#3177](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177)).

Looking forward to receiving feedback on these reviews and seeing these PRs
merged so I can continue making progress on my own work!

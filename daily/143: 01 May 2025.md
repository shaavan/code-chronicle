# Log 143: "A Chapter closed; Another continues"

> 01 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- âœ… Finished
  [#3655](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655),
  introducing `inbound_channel_ids` in `PaymentClaimable`.
- ðŸ§ª Investigated and worked on resolving the Dummy TLV decoding issue.

## Reflections:

Today marked the completion of one chapter, and the deepening of another.

After a final set of updates, I was able to wrap up
[#3655](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655)â€”a
long-running PR that introduced `inbound_channel_ids` into `PaymentClaimable`.
Itâ€™s always satisfying to see these threads tied off, especially when thoughtful

from peers highlights the care and clarity you tried to bring into the work.
Moments like these make the whole journey feel worth it.

With that closed, I turned my attention back to the lingering **Dummy TLVs
bug**. Today, I finally understood the root of the misbehavior: the
`ControlTlvs`' `Readable` implementation is incorrectly interpreting dummy TLVs
as valid `ReceiveTlvs`. It was subtleâ€”and messyâ€”but the kind of puzzle Iâ€™ve come
to appreciate.

Iâ€™m close to the fix now. Hopefully tomorrow brings the breakthrough.

To clear closures, and clarity on what's next. Onward. ðŸš€

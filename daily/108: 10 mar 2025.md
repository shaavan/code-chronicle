# Log 108: "Onto a New Challenge!"

> 10 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Opened a PR solving
  [#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658).

## Reflections:

Today, I decided to tackle one of the **recently assigned issues** and give it a
shot.

The problem? When a user manually handles a received invoice, **multiple
`InvoiceReceived` events** were being generated for the **same invoice**, which
could be **confusing** for users relying on event uniqueness. To resolve this, I
introduced a **simple check** in the codebase to ensure **duplicate events
arenâ€™t created**, making the event system more **predictable and reliable**.

I also added a **test case** to verify that the fix works as expected.

**Another day, another challenge solved!** ðŸš€

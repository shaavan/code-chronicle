# Log 187: _A Gate Opens_

> 08 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Opened the `ReceiveAuthKey` PR:
  [#3917](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3917)
- Updated and discussed the
  [event-model approach](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-16)
  with mentor

## Reflections:

Today was a good day of discussion and forward movement. After a few days of
iteration, I was finally able to open the `ReceiveAuthKey` PR. This introduces
the new authentication key cleanly into the codebase, and with it, opens the
gate for a broader cleanup — simplifying `MessageContext`, and making dummy hop
authentication more space-efficient.

Once that was out, I turned back to the event-model work. After addressing the
latest round of updates, I had a fruitful discussion with my mentor. We agreed
that the cleanest way forward is to double down on a `CurrencyConversion` trait
— making currency resolution synchronous and integrating it naturally into the
event flow.

I’m feeling clear and confident about the direction, and looking forward to
making progress on both fronts tomorrow.

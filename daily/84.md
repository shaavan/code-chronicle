## Reflections:

Today was all about finishing up reviews on PRs I had previously looked into.
The time was spent fruitfully diving deeper into `macros` and `proc_macros`,
understanding how they work, why they are needed, and their role in handling
legacy fields at compile time.

I now have a much clearer understanding of why `proc_macros` are essential in
this contextâ€”they allow for compile-time transformations that simplify working
with older field structures while ensuring type safety and efficiency.

It was a fun day, exploring different dimensions of LDK through the work of my
colleagues. Reviewing their PRs not only helped me refine my own knowledge but
also gave me new perspectives on how different challenges in the codebase are
tackled. ðŸš€

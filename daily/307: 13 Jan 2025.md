# Log 307: Taming the Beast

> 13 Jan 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Updated] the dummy hops implementation

## Reflections

Today was fully dedicated to **dummy hops**.

I started by experimenting with functional test design, but fairly quickly
realized that it would require a much larger and more invasive change than I had
initially anticipated. Rather than letting that balloon the scope of the current
PR, I made a conscious decision to **defer those changes** to a follow-up PR —
one that will focus specifically on functional test updates and enabling the
public API to accept custom payment relay values for dummy hops.

With that decision made, I shifted focus back to finishing the remaining core
work.

The second major task was implementing **recursive peeling of dummy hops**
within the public API. It was a beast in its own right, but with some
persistence (and a fair amount of willpower), I was able to tame it and get it
done today.

I’m glad I pushed through and finished this part. Dummy hops are now in a much
better place.

And now… rest is calling gently, and I will gladly answer.

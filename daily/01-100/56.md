# Log 56: "Back to the Flow"

> 30 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated Offer with no Blinded Path to reintroduce the default
  `create_{offer, refund}_builder`.

## Reflections:

After taking a brief New Year break over the weekend, I jumped back into work
today and implemented one of the updates my mentor and I discussed last week.
While the `create_{offer, refund}_builder_with_router` was a good addition, we
concluded that the default builders were still necessary so users can rely on
the router already parameterized with the `OffersMessageFlow`.

Following this update, I had an in-depth discussion with my mentor about this
change and other updates from the previous week. It was a satisfying discussion
that left me with a clear vision for the tasks I want to accomplish this week.

Hereâ€™s to a great week and a beautiful New Year ahead! ðŸš€

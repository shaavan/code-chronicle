# Log 20: "The End in Sight"

> 15 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Finalized the `OffersMessageFlow` implementation.

## Reflections:

Now we’re talking! I finally figured out an
[approach](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/a29da437e9fef3141a4b90c206d4eeb1461e6e5a)
to make the `OffersMessageFlow` atomic—and it worked like a charm!

But a megalith is still a megalith. It took me over three hours to figure out
the approach, implement it, fix issues in a commit, decide on the next section
of code to tackle, and repeat the process. After structuring the base of
`OffersMessageFlow`, introducing the `OffersMessageHandler` implementation, and
moving `create_offer_builder` and `create_refund_builder`, I’m thrilled to say
the end is finally in sight!

Just two more parts to go: `pay_for_offer` and `request_refund_payment`. This
weekend, I’ll be ready to unleash this beast to the world. I’m so proud of the
progress today!

## Reflections:

This was a week of quiet breakthroughs — not marked by fanfare, but by **depth,
clarity, and persistence**.

It began with heaviness. On the 16th, I wrestled with complex Flow event model
suggestions and left the day uncertain — the kind of day where effort is high
but movement feels invisible. But I held the thread.

The next day, momentum returned. I restructured Dummy Hops back to
authenticating all hops — a pivot aligned with
[PR #3845](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3845), which
will soon optimize that path further. I also made key progress on the event
model by integrating `amount_source` directly into data structures — a small but
meaningful shift toward safer and clearer flow logic.

Midweek brought a problem I’d been circling for days: a failing test in the No
Path Offer branch due to compact path resolution. The solution didn’t come from
brute force, but from a shift in angle — reconfiguring the test to use
full-length blinded paths and bypass resolution entirely. One stone lifted, one
path cleared.

By week’s end, I polished the No Path Offer branch for final review — rebasing
it cleanly post-Flow merge, updating docs, and refining commit messages. It felt
like polishing a poem before it meets the world — quiet, attentive, almost
sacred.

From friction to flow, this week was a reminder:  
Sometimes you don’t fight through complexity — you **listen**, shift, and let it
unfold.

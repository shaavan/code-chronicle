# Week 15: "From Priorities to Progress"

> Week of 04 April 2025 â€“ 09 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **PR Updates and Prioritization:**

  - Revisited and updated
    [#3658](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3658.07) and
    [#3655](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3655.06),
    incorporating review feedback.
  - Took time to map out and prioritize ongoing and upcoming workâ€”clearing
    backlog, surfacing avoidances, and realigning with goals.

- **Flow Overhaul & Design Discussions:**

  - Updated the
    [`Flow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3639.04)
    implementation, refactoring `OffersMessageFlow` to be parameterized over
    `MessageRouter` and `Router`, making it more self-contained and reusable.
  - Engaged in deeper architectural discussions around `Flow`, including how to
    cleanly support custom assessors and asynchronous use-cases in follow-ups.

- **Design Clarity for
  [#3669](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3669):**

  - Explored how to cleanly expose a reply path creation API outside of
    `ChannelManager` without duplicating logic or breaking existing
    integrations.
  - Came to a clear and aligned design direction after discussions with mentor.

- **Dummy Hops â€“ From Concept to PR:**
  - Tackled the nuanced problem of introducing **Dummy Hops** into blinded paths
    to obfuscate timing-based recipient inference.
  - Opened
    [PR #3726](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726),
    providing a clean and extensible solution that systematically decodes dummy
    hops before the final `ReceiveTlvs`.

## Reflections:

This week felt like a **transition from mental clutter to purposeful clarity**.

What began as a week of dusting off neglected threads and facing lingering
uncertainties ended in meaningful breakthroughsâ€”both technically and mentally.
Whether it was restructuring `Flow`, refining how we expose reply path creation,
or finally getting Dummy Hops over the finish line, every update felt like an
act of alignment.

I also realized how much **mental resistance fades** once you simply _look_ at
what youâ€™ve been avoiding. Facing it often reveals it to be much smaller than
the shadow it casts.

From cleanup to creativity, and clarity to contributionâ€”this was a week of real
progress. ðŸš€

# Log 271: Recurrent Recurrence

> 22 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] the recurrence draft implementation

## Reflections

On this relatively relaxed weekend, after finishing the field introduction of
recurrence for the offer, invoice request, and invoice, my goal was to figure
out the best way to implement the **payee flow** for recurrence — and begin
implementing it.

It turned out to be a surprisingly engaging design challenge. First, there's the
ability to create offers with recurrence. Then, handling invoice requests
differently depending on their type — whether it's a one-off, the first invoice
request in a recurrence, or a subsequent one.

Next came the question of **state**: how and where the node should store
recurrence metadata. And finally, once a payment is received, how should the
payee update that recurrence data to keep the tracker in sync — all while
requiring minimal user input?

Each of these problems is its own little boss fight, and figuring them out was
an enjoyable puzzle. Tomorrow, I’ll focus on bringing that design into code.

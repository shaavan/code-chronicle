# Weekly Log 36: In the Details, Foundations Shift

> 27 August – 02 September 2025

## Overview

This week marked steady progress across two emerging efforts: the ongoing PoC
for recurrence and the evolving approach to dummy hops—now extending into
payment paths.

From design decisions to structural questions, the work brought forward the
quieter challenges: introducing new primitives, establishing clear data
contracts, and questioning architectural defaults. Alongside that, I revisited
the core idea of randomness during a seemingly trivial PR review—only to uncover
a deeper philosophical and technical rabbit hole.

A week of details, and the hidden weight they carry.

## Highlights

- Continued developing [recurrence] PoC:

  - Introduced and wired new recurrence-related fields.
  - Explored design trade-offs around separating recurring invoice requests
    structurally.
  - Introduced and supported new primitives like `NonZeroU32`, including custom
    serialization logic.

- Reviewed PR #4033 and explored subtle implications of randomness and
  determinism in system behavior.
- Outlined design direction for dummy hops in **payment** paths, following the
  merge of the [message path dummy hops PR].

## Reflections

Progress this week wasn’t flashy—it was foundational.

Whether introducing new primitives or questioning how recurring requests should
live within the system, I found myself in decisions that shape long-term
structure. Even seemingly small technical moves—like using `NonZeroU32`—required
a deeper reimplementation effort, reminding me of the unseen groundwork that
makes abstraction possible.

The PR review that led to a deep dive on randomness was another highlight. It
started as a 7-line change and became a reflection on predictability, entropy,
and the illusion of chaos. That curiosity-led detour was a valuable reminder:
the simplest problems often reveal the most interesting patterns.

As both recurrence and dummy hops continue to evolve, I’m aware that I’m shaping
paths that others will walk later. That makes this work feel slow at times—but
meaningful.

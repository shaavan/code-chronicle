# Log 279: Retconning Reality

## What I Worked On

- [Implemented] data structures for the payer flow

## Reflections

After finalizing the design and commit structure for the payer flow, I jumped
into implementation today.

As expected, the start had some inertia — I found myself revisiting and
rethinking earlier steps while progressing through the new ones. Some of that
friction came from needing to **retcon** parts of the payee flow: updating
previously implemented fields so they'd make structural sense alongside the
payer logic now being built on top of them.

But after a few rounds of experimentation and mental untangling, I hit a rhythm
by the end of the day. The foundational structures are now in place, and things
are starting to click.

I’m excited to carry this momentum into tomorrow and keep bringing the full
recurrence flow to life.

# Log 202: The Troubles of CI

> 01 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Finalized](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-26) the
  currency branch for upload

## Reflections:

Today was a day of triage, clearance, creation, touch-ups — and a great deal of
patience.

The initial realization was sobering: by trying to hit two birds with one stone
— currency support and the event model — I was doing justice to neither. So I
made the call to focus entirely on currency support, specifically the
synchronous path. With that clarity, the branch finally came together — clean,
sharp, and solid.

Then came the real adversary: making it presentable for a PR.

The first round was straightforward — documentation polish, commit cleanup. But
what followed was the long and winding road of CI — which, on some days, might
as well stand for _Complicated Integration_. Local test runs stretched on
forever, only to fail because of something as trivial as a missing import in a
fuzz test. Then came the fixes. Then more waiting. Then more fixes.

At times, it felt like an infinite loop of run → break → fix → repeat.  
But here's the twist: by the end of it, the branch was tighter than it had ever
been. CI's meticulous nature — frustrating as it is — forced me to confront
every detail. And slowly, painfully, it refined the branch into something much
more solid.

Tough love, from the CI gods. And today, I think I’m thankful for it.

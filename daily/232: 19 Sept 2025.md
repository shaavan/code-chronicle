# Log 232: Refinements & Refinements

> 19 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- Addressed final review suggestions for [#3833].
- Addressed final comments on [#3964].

## Reflections

With the last round of reviews behind me, today was about polishing things
before final pushes.

That meant a round of cleanup, a dedicated self-review (just in case any subtle
quirks slipped past the reviewers), and a final rebase on `main` to resolve
merge conflicts. No big breakthroughsâ€”just careful preparation to ensure things
land smoothly.

A quiet day, but an important part of the whole.

## What I Worked On

- Finished and discussed the next-year proposal

## Reflections

Today was dedicated to bringing the next-year proposal to completion.

After weeks of shaping the technical direction and refining the structure, the
focus today was on polish — tightening the prose, sharpening the narrative, and
ensuring that the document says exactly what I intend it to say.

A proposal is not just a plan of work. It is a statement of clarity: what
problems matter, why they matter, and how I intend to approach them. The final
version needed to carry that conviction.

After wrapping up the writing, I discussed the proposal with my mentor. The
conversation helped pressure-test the framing and affirmed the strength of the
direction.

A clean close to a long-running effort.

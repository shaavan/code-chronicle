# Log 159: A Path to Generalization

> 24 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Explored](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-02) the
  event generalization approach for the Flow event model

## Reflections:

Following up on Tuesday’s discussion with my mentor, I dove deeper into the
event model we’re shaping for Flow’s async-based follow-up. Looking back at the
[first version](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-01),
we realized something subtle but significant — the model becomes far more
elegant and flexible when we **generalize the events**.

Instead of defining a new event for every specific case, we now aim to emit
**highly informative, generalized events**. The specificity, instead, comes from
the **trigger conditions**, which can be tailored by the user. It’s a small
shift in approach, but one that changes everything — reducing complexity,
improving clarity, and expanding possibility.

As I walked through the code with this new lens, I could feel the design coming
together in a cleaner, more intentional way.

What a day of insight. The path is getting clearer.

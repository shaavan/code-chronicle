# Log 211: Letâ€™s Test It!

> 14 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Improved and refined the [currency] branch, and introduced a test for
  asynchronous currency support.

## Reflections:

After Tuesdayâ€™s discussion with my mentor, today was all about refining the
currency branch â€” moving it to support only asynchronous currency handling â€” and
adding the first dedicated test for it.

The test setup is going smoothly so far, and while there are a few roadblocks
ahead, Iâ€™m looking forward to overcoming them tomorrow. Hereâ€™s to refined work!

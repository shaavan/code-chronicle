# Log 183: Into the Cryptographic Depths

> 30 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Studied and reviewed
  [#3845](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3845) to
  prepare for continuing its implementation.

## Reflections:

Today was one of those rare and exciting days where you dive deep into a domain
that’s always been close by — but rarely explored in full.

Remember the
[Dummy TLVs](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726) PR?
We’d reached a stable point with it, implementing a reliable mechanism for
authentication. But it came at a cost: the added authentication data inflated
the size of each dummy TLV, making it harder to properly mask them from regular
Forward TLVs using padding.

That’s where
[#3845](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3845) enters the
scene. A teammate introduced a clever approach to retain authentication
guarantees **without** needing per-hop auth data in each TLV — solving the core
problems that currently limit Dummy TLVs.

However, the PR is still in progress and needs further work to reach
merge-readiness.

So today, I set aside my builder’s hat and wore the learner-reviewer’s one. I
spent the day thoroughly studying the cryptographic underpinnings of the PR:
diving into concepts like ChaCha20, Poly1305, and AAD (Additional Authenticated
Data) to understand both the design and the trade-offs. The goal: be fully ready
to pick up this work and carry it forward tomorrow.

It felt like solving a riddle in a foreign language — and slowly, word by word,
it started to sing. A beautiful day of learning.

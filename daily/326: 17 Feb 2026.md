# Log 326: Crossing the Hurdles

> 17 Feb 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] and discussed currency conversion implementation

## Reflections

Today was focused on discussion and clearing architectural hurdles.

While working on the currency implementation, I ran into two key concerns.
First, how to efficiently pass the `CurrencyConversion` trait during the
`InvoiceRequest` building process without introducing excessive trait clutter.
Second, how to handle currency validation checks cleanly during `InvoiceRequest`
parsing.

I brought both questions to my mentor, and the discussion led to useful
suggestions on how to approach them. The ideas feel promising, but I’d like to
test them thoroughly before moving forward.

More experimentation tomorrow.

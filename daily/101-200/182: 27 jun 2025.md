# Log 182: _Cleaned, Reviewed, Discussed_

> 27 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Refined and
  [discussed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-14) the
  latest Event Model approach with mentor

## Reflections:

Today was a day of refinement — not in scope, but in **structure, clarity, and
care**.

After completing the core implementation of the new Event Model approach
yesterday, today was about **shaping** it: organizing the code, cleaning up
naming and layout, and ensuring that the structure reads cleanly to anyone who
opens the branch — whether tomorrow or months later.

And I’m proud of how far it came. For comparison, here’s
[yesterday’s commit history](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-13),
and here’s
[today’s](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-14).  
Quite the transformation, right? :)

Once that layer was complete, I shared the work with my mentor. We had a
productive discussion, focusing on test coverage and edge case checks. And I was
happy to see the structure stand strong — only a few minor improvements were
identified.

Today reaffirmed a quiet truth: **when a system is well-thought-out, the review
becomes a dialogue, not a rescue mission.**

A good day, indeed.

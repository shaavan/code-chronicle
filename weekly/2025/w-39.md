# Weekly Log 39: Verifying the Future

> 19 – 25 September 2025

## Overview

This week marked a natural turning point—from final polish and cleanup on older
branches to fresh architectural work on new ones.

The week began with quiet, focused refinement: I addressed the last batch of
review suggestions on both [#3833] and [#3964], making sure those PRs were
clean, rebased, and ready to merge. With those wrapped up, I had space to zoom
back into deeper, more foundational work.

Mid-week, I finalized and opened a new PR introducing [AAD-based verification] for
blinded payment paths. It’s a design I’m particularly excited about—leaner, simpler,
and path-focused. It lays the groundwork for something I’ve been meaning to tackle
next: **dummy hops for blinded payment paths**.

That work has already begun. And while it’s early, I’m facing interesting design
decisions—particularly around how best to “peel” dummy hops cleanly into the
existing packet flow.

This coming week, the focus shifts fully onto that challenge.

## Highlights

- Final refinements and cleanup for:

  - [#3833] – event model structure improvements.
  - [#3964] – stronger invoice request validation.

- Finished implementation of [AAD-based verification] for blinded payment paths:

  - Moved from per-hop to path-level authentication using AAD.
  - Simplified the logic while improving privacy guarantees.

- Opened a new PR: [#4126]
- Started work on dummy hops for payment paths:
  - Early experimentation and design questions underway.

## Reflections

This was a week of transition—from shipping to seeding.  
The groundwork has been laid. Now begins the deep work of shaping what comes
next.

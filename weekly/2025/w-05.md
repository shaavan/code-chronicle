# Week 05: "Refinement & New Beginnings"

> Week of 25 Jan 2025 â€“ 29 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was a mix of refining existing work and stepping into a new and
exciting project. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key progress:

- **Finalizing PR Cleanups**:

  - Updated [#3504](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3504)
    and made minor refinements across multiple PRs.
  - Reviewed
    [#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378), which
    deepened my understanding of TLV mapping and its impact on backward
    compatibility.

- **Preparing for Next Yearâ€™s Work**:

  - Made significant progress on my **next-year proposal**, focusing on a core
    spec for a **Payment Notification System**, which Iâ€™ll be working on in
    conjunction with my mentor.

- **Diving into Payment Notification Research**:

  - Spent time analyzing past work on **Payment Notifications**, identifying
    gaps, and brainstorming solutions to ensure an effective and flexible
    implementation.

- **Optimizing Padding Analysis**:
  - Revisited and updated the **Padding** analysis to account for size overhead
    introduced by padding storage itself, ensuring optimal space efficiency
    while maintaining buffer integrity.

## Reflections:

This week was one of balanceâ€”refining and polishing past work while preparing
for an exciting new challenge. Cleaning up PRs gave me a sense of closure, while
the deep dive into **Payment Notification** research brought a fresh wave of
excitement.

One of the most rewarding moments was analyzing TLV mapping and discovering a
potential backward compatibility issueâ€”it reminded me how much diligence matters
in code reviews. Similarly, the Payment Notification research was invigorating,
pushing me to think critically about a design problem and its long-term impact.

As I step into this next phase, Iâ€™m looking forward to not just implementing
features but **shaping a core piece of the Lightning Networkâ€™s future**. ðŸš€

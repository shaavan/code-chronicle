# Log 286: Payer Powers Activated

> 10 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Introduced] recurrence functions for the payer flow

## Reflections

With invoice handling completed yesterday, today I moved on to the next stage:  
introducing the ability to **send successive invoice requests** in the
recurrence flow.

This began with two new functions:

- `pay_for_recurrence(invreq_id)`: sends the next invoice request in the
  sequence
- `cancel_recurrence(invreq_id)`: removes the recurrence session from memory and
  sends a stub “cancel recurrence” request to the payee

Both are now in place and form the core of **payer-side control** over recurring
payments — continuing them or shutting them down cleanly.

With this implemented, the next step is wiring up **event triggers** to drive
these flows automatically. But that’ll have to wait until tomorrow.

# Log 74: "Preserving History"

> 22 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated the `OffersMessageFlow`
  [branch](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/omf-25).

## Reflections:

Following yesterday’s productive discussion with my mentor, I focused on
addressing improvements for `OffersMessageFlow`. Today’s goal was to manage a
clean commit history while preserving `git blame` integrity for the significant
code movements required by this branch.

I concentrated on minimizing transitory code movement by ensuring the original
functions were simply called from the flow, instead of relocating them
prematurely. This approach helped preserve the original function’s `git blame`
and reduced unnecessary noise in the commit history.

It felt great to check off another task for `OffersMessageFlow`. Sometimes even
simple-looking challenges teach you a lot about thoughtful structuring and
process.

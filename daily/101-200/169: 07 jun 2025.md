# Log 169: _Welcome, `Events`_

> 07 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Opened the
  [Event Model](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3833) PR

## Reflections:

After all the refinements, cleanups, and final bug fixes, the Flow Event Model
PR is finally open — and it feels good to release it into the world on a calm
weekend.

I’m proud of the shape it’s taken. The structure is clean, the intent is clear,
and the groundwork is solid. It’s ready — not just to be seen, but to be tested,
challenged, and strengthened through review.

Now begins the next phase: feedback, iteration, and collaboration.  
And I feel ready for it.

Welcome, `Events`. You’ve arrived.

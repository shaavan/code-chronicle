# Log 105: "Closing Chapters; Opening Chapters"

> 06 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **Finished two PRs**:
  - [Padding PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3177).
  - [Bolt11 Payment Flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3617#issuecomment-2703730622).
- **Discussed updates and thoughts on** the
  [Flow approach](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#discussion_r1983337160).

## Reflections:

Today marked the **closing of some chapters and the opening of new ones**.

After a long series of updates, **the Padding PR is finally complete!**
Alongside it, the **Bolt11 Payment Flow PR is also reaching its conclusion.** It
feels like **a day of milestones**â€”a moment to celebrate the work put in over
time.

With those wrapped up, I shifted focus to **engaging with feedback on the Flow
PR**. The discussions helped me critically assess the approach, sparking deeper
insights and refinements.

Looking ahead, Iâ€™m excited to **keep the momentum going** as new ideas take
shape! ðŸš€

# Log 27: "Tea, Calm, Docs"

> 23 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Polished the documentation for `OffersMessageFlow`.

## Reflections:

On a slow and calm weekend, accompanied by a warm cup of tea, I focused on
refining the `OffersMessageFlow` documentation. The goal was to make it clean,
proper, and of the highest qualityâ€”and the process felt just as peaceful as the
day itself!

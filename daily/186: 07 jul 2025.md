# Log 186: _Laying the Foundation_

> 07 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Completed the first version of the
  [#3845 extension](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/3845-mac)

## Reflections:

Today was about shaping the base. I focused on wrapping up and polishing the
initial version of the #3845 extension — introducing the new `ReceiveAuthKey`
and preparing the ground for simplifying and cleaning up repeated
`MessageContext` (HMAC, Nonce) logic across the codebase.

With the scaffolding now in place, the next step will be twofold: continue the
clean-up within the PR itself, and resume work on the event-model in preparation
for tomorrow’s mentor sync. One brick at a time — but the foundation feels
strong.

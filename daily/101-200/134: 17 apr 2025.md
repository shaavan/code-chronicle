# Log 134: "And Here Comes Flow"

> 17 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finished and submitted the **Q4 report**.
- Addressed latest
  [Flow updates](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2813531672).

## Reflections:

Today, I finally wrapped up the Q4 reportâ€”and Iâ€™m genuinely proud of how it
turned out. I shared it with my mentor, and now Iâ€™m looking forward to hearing
his thoughts. Reflecting on the past quarter through the report gave me a real
sense of the ground Iâ€™ve covered.

With that done, I dove back into the Flow updates and tackled the remaining
pieces. And with that, I was finally able to **rebase the PR on `main` and move
it from draft to ready for review**.

A solid day of wrapping things up and setting the stage for whatâ€™s nextâ€”a day of
celebration indeed! ðŸš€

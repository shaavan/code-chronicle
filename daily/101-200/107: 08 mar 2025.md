# Log 107: "And It's Out!"

> 08 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Published the new PR:
  [#3655](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655).

## Reflections:

Today, I focused on **applying the final touch-ups** to the branch solving
[#2274](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2274), and it
all came together smoothly!

While reviewing yesterdayâ€™s branch, I realized that the way I had structured the
TLVs **would have broken backward compatibility**â€”a crucial catch. So, I
**refined the approach**, ensuring that the new vector of inbound channels is
properly introduced while also **preserving support** for users on older
versions of LDK. Felt great to **preemptively solve a problem before it even
came up in review!**

Beyond that, I **cleaned up the commits, improved the documentation, and
polished the PR**, making it more structured and presentable.

Excitedly looking forward to feedback from my peers! ðŸš€

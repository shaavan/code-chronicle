# Log 113: "Let's Have a Thought Experiment"

> 18 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Spent time brainstorming a solution for
  [#3669](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3669).
- Discussed Flow updates and #3669 with my mentor.

## Reflections:

Today was a day of **planning and thoughtful discussions**.

I started by diving into a new feature request Matt posted. The concern was that
currently, **blinded paths can only be created via the `ChannelManager` flow**,
since the underlying peer state data needed for path creation isn’t exposed
otherwise. This makes it difficult for users to generate blinded reply paths
independently of `ChannelManager`.

So I proposed a potential solution—**introducing a new trait** that could be
implemented by anything capable of providing a list of peers. We could then make
the blinded path creation function **take this trait as input**, decoupling it
from `ChannelManager`. That way, anyone providing peer data could create blinded
paths without being forced through core `ChannelManager` logic.

After discussing this with my mentor and going through a few iterations, we
concluded that while the idea is viable and addresses the concern well, **it
might already be possible to create blinded paths outside of `ChannelManager`**
with the current setup—we just need to verify the specifics. I’ll be reaching
out to Matt to clarify that soon.

In the second half of the day, I focused on **reviewing and discussing
yesterday’s Flow update** with my mentor. We identified a few more areas for
improvement, which I’ll begin refining shortly.

All in all, a **productive day spent sharpening the sword of action**. ⚔️

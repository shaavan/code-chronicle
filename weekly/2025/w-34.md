# Weekly Log 34: A Step Beyond

> 14 Aug â€“ 19 Aug 2025

## What I Worked On

- Finalized the [currency approach], completing cleanup and preparing the branch
  for PR.
- Investigated and documented a **potential bug** with invoice requests where an
  absent amount, combined with currency-denominated offers, could silently
  bypass checks.
- Explored two approaches for fixing the issue:
  1. Storing a unit conversion factor derived from the `CurrencyConversion`
     trait.
  2. Restricting creation of invoice requests without explicit amounts for
     currency-denominated offers.  
     Settled on the second approach after discussion with mentor.
- Expanded documentation for the `CurrencyConversion` trait to explicitly note
  handling of ISO 4217 exponents.
- Had a mentor meeting focused on **future directions and meaningful projects**
  to pursue in Lightning development.

## Reflections

This week was about **closure and clarity**. Closing the loop on the currency
approach gave me momentum, while the investigation into the invoice request bug
showed me the importance of catching subtle edge cases early.

Discussions with my mentor helped sharpen not only immediate fixes but also how
I want to direct my efforts in the longer run. Iâ€™m starting to see the horizon
of deeper, more impactful contributions opening up. ðŸš€

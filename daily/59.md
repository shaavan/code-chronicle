# Log 59: "Slow and Steady"

> 02 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Re-worked on solving
  [#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320).

## Reflections:

Today, I revisited the challenge of solving
[#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320). This
time, instead of jumping straight into coding, I took a different approach—I
spent time studying the codebase thoroughly. I focused on understanding how
HTLCs are claimed on-chain once the channels are closed, meticulously planning
each step before diving into implementation.

To my surprise, this strategy worked! I was able to create a
[working version](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/i3320-2) of
the updated test. While the event at the end currently shows failure instead of
success, I feel like I’m 90% there. It’s a significant step forward, and I’m
really happy with the progress.

Sometimes, slow and steady really does win the race. :)

# Log 198: _Cleared and Committed_

> 26 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Opened](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3964) the
  `VerifiedInvoiceRequest<S>` PR

## Reflections:

Finally today, after a long wait and much clearing, I opened the new PR that
introduces compile-time checks through `VerifiedInvoiceRequest<S>`.

It felt exciting — cleaning up a part of the code I’ve looked at so often,
worked around for so long, and now finally reshaped into something clean and
precise. With this in place, it sets the stage for what comes next in the
event-model and currency-handling updates.

A good day of good work indeed.

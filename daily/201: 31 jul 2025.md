# Log 201: Reevaluate, Restructure, Execute

> 31 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Significantly restructured and expanded the
  [Event Model](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-25)

## Reflections:

Today was a day of stepping back to look forward.

I’ve been working on the event model for a while, and over time, certain
decisions started to feel unfinished — as if the design had evolved beyond its
original framing. So I decided to pause and reevaluate. From the introduction of
the currency trait in the `amount_msats` of the invoice builder to embedding
that trait into the `OffersMessageFlow` itself — I revisited each choice, one by
one.

That process helped me see the order more clearly, and in doing so, revealed a
missing piece: before introducing the event model and currency trait
integration, we need a more appropriate constructor for the `ChannelManager`.
Without that, the design wouldn’t feel clean or composable.

With the plan now clear, the rest of the day moved into execution — and it felt
good. The branch is still in motion, and I’m sure more challenges will unfold as
I near completion. But today felt like a real shift — not just in structure, but
in clarity.

To an ever-evolving journey, one thoughtful step at a time.

# Log 64: "Sharing & Seeking Clarity"

> 09 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3514)
  addressing
  [#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320).

## Reflections:

After giving a focused attempt to resolve the issue of incorrect event
generation while expanding the test in
[#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320), I
decided the best way forward was to open a PR and seek feedback from my peers.

It can feel a little vulnerable to share unfinished work publicly, but often,
that vulnerability is exactly what’s needed to move forward. Sharing my work and
asking for help when stuck feels like an act of courage—but it’s also the key to
unlocking deeper understanding and fostering collaboration.

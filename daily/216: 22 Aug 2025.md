## Reflections

After a long wait—and even longer spent refining ideas, cleaning up
architecture, and polishing edges—it was finally time to push the event-model
update.

This PR wasn’t the biggest I’ve worked on, but it felt like the heaviest. So
many ideas were developed, then scrapped. So many approaches reached completion,
then got abandoned. Improvements gave way to cleanups, and cleanups to rewrites.
Each step felt like chasing a mirage.

Even at the finish line, my mind reached for just _one more tweak_ before
hitting the button. It’s funny how perfectionism can sneak in, especially when
you’ve poured so much into something over time. You care more—and it still
doesn’t feel enough.

But eventually, I had to take the leap. And that broke the spell.  
The work is out now. Let it speak for itself.

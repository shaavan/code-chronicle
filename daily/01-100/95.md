# Log 95: "Travels on Rebase"

> 20 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Rebased](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr2830.14) Custom
  Data on `main`.

## Reflections:

Even amidst a long day of travel, I managed to carve out some **quality time**
to get good work done!

While reviewing my PRs, I found it amusing that **the smallest one had the
largest number of merge conflicts**. With my eyes set on the challenge, I spent
the day **getting `Custom Data` back in shape**.

The process took **longer and required more focus** than expected—there were so
many conflicts that **reimplementing the commit turned out to be easier than
resolving them** one by one. But in the end, it was a **fun exercise**, and I’m
glad I was able to **make meaningful progress despite the travel-heavy day**.

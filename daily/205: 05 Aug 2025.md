# Log 205: Moving on Fronts

> 05 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Continued studying the
  [Recurrence Spec PR](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240)
- Worked on addressing suggestions on
  [#3964](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3964)
- Discussed progress, questions, and ideas with my mentor

## Reflections:

Today was a day of progress on multiple fronts.

I began by continuing my exploration of the Recurrence PR. It offered a lot of
insight into how feature design happens at the spec level — the subtle
trade-offs, the rationale behind each addition, and the elegance of good
abstraction. As I studied, I jotted down questions for further clarity.

Then, I returned to implementation. After introducing
[#3964](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3964), the
overall consensus seemed positive. Most of the feedback revolved around
documentation and naming improvements, and I took my time addressing them with
care. With those revisions halfway done, I connected with my mentor — discussing
ongoing work, raising the questions I'd gathered, and diving deeper into the
recurrence spec. The conversation helped untangle a lot.

A day of learning, refining, and growing — both in code and in clarity.

# Log 319: Working Around the Blocker

> 03 Feb 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on the dummy hops follow-up
- Made progress on the proposal for the coming year

## Reflections

Today, while recovering from a fever and easing back into work, progress came by
_working around_ a blocker rather than forcing through it.

I’m currently stuck on a quirky bug in the dummy hops follow-up, so instead of
spinning on it, I shifted focus to a related and meaningful piece of work:
figuring out how to account for **fees earned through dummy hops** in a separate
field within the payment claimable data. It’s an interesting design problem in
its own right, and exploring it helped keep momentum while also opening up some
promising solution paths to revisit later.

After stepping away from implementation work for a bit, I switched gears and
returned to the **next-year proposal**. With some distance and fresh eyes, I can
finally see the narrative taking clearer shape. There are still a few kinks left
to iron out, but it’s coming together in a way that feels coherent and
intentional.

I’m looking forward to finishing up those last pieces before the end of the
week.

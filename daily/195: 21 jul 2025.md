# Log 195: _Momentum Across Fronts_

> 21 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726#issuecomment-3096535282)
  the Dummy Hops branch
- [Expanded](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-18)
  further on the Event-Model
- Continued work on the Q2 progress report

## Reflections:

Today brought steady progress across multiple fronts.

First, with the recent merge of `ReceiveAuthKey`, I turned my attention to
bringing the Dummy Hops branch back up to date. In doing so, I also tracked down
and resolved a subtle issue that was causing faulty Dummy Hop processing — one
of those quiet bugs that hides in plain sight until you give it focused
attention.

Next, I picked up the thread of the event model work. With the foundation for
currency conversion now in place, I moved toward defining new event types and
writing helper methods that let the user manually respond to incoming Bolt12
messages with clarity and ease.

And finally, I returned to the quarterly report — adding more nuance and
precision to the reflections, filling in the spaces where depth was still
waiting to be written.

It feels good to feel momentum again — not just on one track, but many.  
Onwards.

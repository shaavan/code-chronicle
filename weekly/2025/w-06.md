# Week 06: "Structure, Reviews & Refinements"

> Week of 31 Jan 2025 â€“ 06 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was a **blend of refining existing work, reviewing PRs, and planning
structured improvements** for upcoming updates. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key
highlights:

- **Final Updates to Padding PR**: After analyzing feedback, I made **final
  refinements** to the Padding PR, ensuring optimal storage efficiency before it
  moves toward merging.

- **Diving into Reviews**: I took time to **review multiple PRs**, including:

  - [#3576](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3576) â€“
    Addressing Rust formatting updates.
  - [#3579](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3579) â€“
    Enhancing `LengthReadable` functionality.
  - [#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378) â€“ Proc
    macros & legacy field handling.
  - [#3581](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3581) â€“
    Faster RGS application for improved sync speed.

  Reviewing these PRs helped **deepen my understanding of different areas in
  LDK**, from Rust macros to network optimizations.

- **Payment Notification & OffersMessageFlow Discussions**: I had an
  **insightful discussion with my mentor** about the **Payment Notification
  system**, breaking down its core ideas, reasoning behind design choices, and
  key areas for improvement. Additionally, we discussed **structuring
  `OffersMessageFlow`** to cleanly separate **onion message handling** from
  **payment-related processes**â€”leading to some exciting breakthroughs.

- **Refactoring & Structuring `OffersMessageFlow`**: After implementing previous
  updates, I **realized the need for a cleaner, structured update path**. I
  spent time planning **how best to structure changes** so that each update
  logically builds on the next, avoiding unnecessary backtracking or overlapping
  commits.

## Reflections:

This week was all about **refining, reviewing, and restructuring**.

- **Refining** PRs to bring them closer to merging.
- **Reviewing** others' work to deepen my understanding and contribute valuable
  feedback.
- **Restructuring** my own work to ensure clarity and maintainability.

The **discussion on Payment Notification & OffersMessageFlow** was especially
rewarding, leading to new insights that will shape my work in the coming weeks.
And the **process of structuring `Flow` updates** gave me a deeper appreciation
for clean commit history and progressive refinements.

As I move forward, Iâ€™m excited to **bring structure and clarity** to my work and
push forward with new developments. ðŸš€

# Log 240: Silence & Wait

## What I Worked On

- Tried [debugging] the Dummy Payment Hops issue.

## Reflections

The problem was tougher than I imagined.

After introducing the ability to create blinded payment paths with dummy hops
last time, I wrote the first test and began debugging. As expected, the first
version failed — but what surprised me was _where_ the failures surfaced. The
issues aren’t in the code I wrote, but in adjacent areas that, in theory,
shouldn’t have been affected by the dummy hops PR at all.

It’s annoying. And the debugging journey continues.

Today, though, I have only my struggles to show.  
And this time, I’ll end without a hopeful note.  
I want the work itself to speak — when it’s ready, alive, scarred, and standing
strong, with the spark of victory in its eyes.

Today, I’ll remain silent.  
And wait.

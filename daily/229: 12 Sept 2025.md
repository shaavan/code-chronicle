# Log 229: A Quiet Victory

> 12 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Refined] the flow for accepting recurring payments.

## Reflections

Today was a tough one.

Yesterday, the flu hit its peak—and despite all my intention to work, I just
couldn’t. Today wasn’t much better, but I managed to push through, even if just
a little. And that counts.

Knowing that [#3964] improves parts of the invoice request–response flow, I
decided it was time to build the recurrence branch on top of it. So, I started
by rebasing the branch, integrating the changes, and making the necessary
refinements to align the flow. Minor fixups, some polish—but important
groundwork.

It wasn’t a high-output day, but it was a meaningful one.  
Some days, progress is measured in lines of code.  
Today, it was measured in _showing up_.

## What I Worked On

- [Opened] recurrence PoC branch

## Reflections

Today was the day to finally present my work to the world — and that means more
than just code. It means making the work **understandable**, and ideally,
_reviewable without inducing suffering_.

So, today was all about **presentation**. I focused on crafting a clean commit
history, writing an expansive and well-structured commit message, and putting
together a thoughtful [PR introduction][PR].

I'm proud of the result — and proud of how it all came together.

Tomorrow: back to the mysterious realm of payment dummy.

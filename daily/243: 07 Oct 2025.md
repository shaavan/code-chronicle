# Log 243: The Day of Clarity

> 07 Oct 2025

## What I Worked On

- Finished preparing the quarterly report.
- Discussed improved approaches for Dummy Hops in Blinded Payment Paths with
  mentor.

## Reflections

Today was a day of single focus: **get the report done**.  
A day to look back on months of work—not just to feel a sense of accomplishment,
but to express it in a way that justifies the trust others have placed in me.

After wrapping it up, I shared the report with my mentor for final feedback
before submission.  
And speaking of mentorship, our conversation didn’t stop there. We also
discussed the ongoing challenges around Dummy Hops for Blinded Payment Paths.

Laying out the problem to him brought sudden clarity. His suggestion simplified
my current design by nearly an order of magnitude—fewer moving parts, cleaner
logic, clearer intent. The idea makes intuitive sense; all that’s left now is to
test it on the ground and work through the implementation details.

An exciting day, pointing toward an even more exciting tomorrow.

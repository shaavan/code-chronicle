# Weekly Log 24: _Polish, Merge, and Move Forward_

> Week of 05 June – 13 June 2025

## Highlights:

- Finalized and merged the
  [`Flow`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639) event
  model PR after extensive refinements
- Completed and pushed the new
  [`Dummy Hops`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726)
  implementation with authenticated-first-hop design
- Opened a fresh PR for the Flow event model
  ([#3833](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3833))
- Resolved a decoding bug in the dummy hop path and polished logic and
  documentation
- Discussed architectural clarity for DummyTlvs, Event Model improvements, and
  the No-Path Offer design
- Updated open branches to rebase cleanly after `OffersMessageFlow` was merged

## Reflections:

This week was a shift from construction to **clarity and convergence**.

It began with intense polish — refining Flow’s event model to the point of both
functional solidity and expressive clarity. Returning `InvoiceBuilder` instead
of pre-signed invoices, supporting fiat-denominated custom amounts — these
weren’t just optimizations, but deliberate design choices that made the system
more flexible and user-respectful. That effort culminated in the opening of a
clean, review-ready PR. A deeply satisfying merge.

Alongside that, I finalized the new Dummy Hops model. What started as a
performance tweak matured into a thoughtful privacy upgrade — only the first
dummy hop is now authenticated, reducing size without compromising the core
idea. A decoding bug in that logic gave me a momentary pause, but it was cracked
with care.

Midweek, a meaningful discussion with my mentor helped crystallize three paths
forward:

- **Dummy Hops** still needs to reach full anonymization, as the authenticated
  dummy still stands out.
- **The Event Model** is close to final but can avoid redundant logic around
  `amount_source` derivation.
- **The No-Path Offer** is ready — with a tweak to default to compact blinded
  paths for simplicity and practicality.

By the week’s end, OffersMessageFlow was merged — and that ripple meant several
of my branches needed rebasing and cleanup. That work, though slower, felt
steady. Re-aligning code, re-aligning priorities.

This was a week of **refinement, resolution, and quiet rigor**. The kind of week
where the code gets leaner, the mind gets clearer, and the road ahead feels just
a bit more open.

# Log 231: The Other Frontier

## What I Worked On

- [Addressed] review suggestions for the [currency] PR.

## Reflections

Today I took a short break from recurrence to focus on another important thread:
the currency PR.

Following a detailed round of review from my colleagues, I spent the day
addressing their feedback and refining the implementation. It felt good to
switch gears and keep momentum going across concurrent workstreams.

Bit by bit, the pieces are falling into place.

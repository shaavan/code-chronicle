# Log 04: "Proc Macros & Journey of Tackling the Chaos"

> 27 Oct 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Reviewed [#3378](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3378),
  introducing proc macro magic for legacy TLV support.

## Reflections:

I did it! I reviewed my first PR involving macros and proc macros in Rust.
Honestly, I’d been procrastinating on this for a few days, feeling like I was
stepping a bit too far into chaos.  
Then, I switched up my approach. Instead of “reviewing” the PR, I focused on
simply “understanding” it for myself. I asked questions and worked through
answers. In that process, the path began to clear, chaos turned to order, and a
“review” naturally emerged.

This might be a game-changing revelation for how I’ll approach new things in the
future!  
Maxim of today: _"Don’t try to solve; try to understand!"_

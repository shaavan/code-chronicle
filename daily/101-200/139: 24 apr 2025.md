# Log 139: "A Day of Documentation"

> 24 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Fixed Flow CI.
- [Expanded](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2827874785)
  documentation for Flow utilities.

## Reflections:

Today, I sat with one of the most important parts of writing
code—**documentation**.

With Flow utilities nearly complete, the next challenge was to explain the
_how_, the _why_, and the _when_—to **document the usage** of each function in a
way that’s not only technically sound, but also **clear and accessible to any
LDK user** who comes across it.

And I have to say—it was a fun and revealing exercise. As I wrote, I found
myself learning more about my own code: how different parameters and inputs
interact—not just within the bounds of a function, but within the **larger
architecture of LDK** itself.

By the end of the session, I felt a deeper understanding of what I’d built.
There’s truth to what Feynman said:

> _“The best way to learn is to teach.”_

Today, I felt that truth firsthand—teaching the code helped me **understand it
better** than before. A satisfying, reflective day.

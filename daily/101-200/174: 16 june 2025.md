- [Addressed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-09)
  suggestions for the Flow event model

## Reflections:

Today felt like trying to dig through stone.

I put in focused effort, trying to address a particularly tough batch of
suggestions for the Flow event model. It was one of those technical challenges
where progress isn’t always visible — where even after hours of work, you’re
unsure how much ground you’ve really broken.

I had hoped to clear through many of the pending comments across my open PRs —
but in the end, I only managed to work through one. And honestly, that left me
feeling a little low.

But even as I say that, I know: these days are part of the rhythm. The
resistance, the effort, the fog — they always come before clarity.

So I’ll rest tonight not in frustration, but in trust — that what I moved today,
even if unseen, will help loosen what’s ahead.

Onward, toward the clarity that’s waiting to emerge.

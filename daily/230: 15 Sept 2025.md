# Log 230: Back on Ground

> 15 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Addressed] review suggestions for [#3964].

## Reflections

After a weekend of much-needed rest and recovery, I finally felt back on my feet
today.

I spent the day addressing the final set of review suggestions on [#3964].
Getting through them felt good—both as a return to flow and as a step toward
closing a long-standing thread.

Once this PR is merged, the ground will be solid for recurrence development to
move forward.  
And I’m genuinely excited to pick that thread back up.

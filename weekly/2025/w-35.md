# Weekly Log 35: Tying Knots and Lighting Paths

> 20 August - 25 August 2025

## Overview

This week marked a transition from deep architectural work to pushing major
updates toward completion. After wrapping up the currency flow, my focus shifted
to finalizing the event-model, getting dummy hops into shape, and defending the
_Stronger IR Check_ PR through collaborative review. It was a week of big
pushes, thoughtful conversations, and incremental victories—aka, the software
engineering dream.

## Highlights

- **Finalized and pushed the [event-model] PR** after extensive design, cleanup,
  and internal back-and-forth.
- **Completed dummy hops for message paths** and prepared the [dummy hops] PR for
  merge.
- **Started planning dummy hops for payment paths**, which promises to be _extra
  spicy_.
- **Engaged in detailed review discussion** with a teammate on the [Stronger
  IR Check] PR—resulting in clarification of intent and eventual approval.
- **Maintained steady forward motion** despite the creeping perfectionism that
  tends to show up right before pushing big branches.

## Reflections

This week was defined not just by the code I wrote, but by the conversations it
sparked. Especially with the Stronger IR Check PR—where explaining my thought
process forced me to revalidate and distill the design.

It’s clear that my work is entering a more collaborative phase, where success
depends as much on communication as it does on implementation. That’s both
intimidating and exciting.

As I look toward next week, the roadmap is clear: dummy hops for payment paths.
It’s going to require experimentation, testing, and maybe a little chaos.  
Wouldn’t have it any other way.

# Log 184: Closing Chapters, Opening Doors

> 1 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Finalised](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246#issuecomment-3023773208)
  the last version of the Offer with No Blinded Path.
- Discussed breakthroughs and future direction for the Event-Model with mentor.

## Reflections:

At last, after a long and thoughtful journey, I’ve wrapped up the Offer with No
Blinded Path work — addressing the final round of reviews focused on
documentation and a few remaining code refinements. It’s satisfying to look back
at how this branch introduced a cleaner, more intuitive flow for blinded path
creation. A solid contribution, now complete.

The second half of the day was devoted to forward-looking discussions —
specifically on the evolving architecture of the Event-Model. We explored how to
better support asynchronous currency handling, and in the process, surfaced a
few compelling ideas for structuring the creation logic in a way that’s both
robust and flexible.

It felt like the perfect rhythm: tying up the past, and opening new doors for
what’s next. A good day — of closure, and of new beginnings.

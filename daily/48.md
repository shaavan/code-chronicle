# Log 48: "A Milestone Achieved"

> 18 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Completed the first draft of the new
  [approach](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-7)
  for asynchronous responses.

## Reflections:

I received the best surprise this holiday season—I’ve been made a member of the
[Lightning Dev Kit](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/) repository!

This feels like such an incredible milestone and a true day of achievement. It’s
amazing to see all the effort and hard work bearing fruit. I’m so grateful and
happy today!

Time for a mid-week celebration to mark this moment! :)

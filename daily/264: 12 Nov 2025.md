## What I Worked On

- [Addressed] suggestions on [#4126].

## Reflections

After receiving a few valuable suggestions on [#4126] yesterday, I dedicated
today to finishing them — pushing forward a piece of work that’s now in its
final stage of review.

Amid the weight of other open projects, this small act of closure felt like a
breath of fresh air — a reminder that progress isn’t always about breakthroughs,
but about tying the knots that move the larger journey forward.

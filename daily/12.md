# Log 12: "On Testing"

> 07 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Introduced custom TLV tests in
  [#2830](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830).

## Reflections:

With the introduction of tests, I was finally able to open (or reopen) this
long-drafted PR. During testing, I uncovered many unfinished edges, which I was
able to refine, getting the tests to run smoothly.

Before testing, the code ran perfectly in my mind, but without a true sense of
completeness or fulfillment. It was only under scrutiny that the code revealed
its flaws, and only after addressing them did the code feel "real"—bringing a
sense of fulfillment.

This reminded me of a quote by Seneca: _“No man is more unhappy than he who
never faces adversity. For he is not permitted to prove himself.”_

And as with man, so with code. It’s often hard to recognize one’s flaws—or
strengths—until put to the test.

# Log 246: The Other Half

> 11 Oct 2025

## What I Worked On

- Planned the sending recurrence payment flow.

## Reflections

On a relaxed day, after completing the two major tasks of the week — submitting
the quarterly progress report and [opening] the Dummy Payment Hops PR — I
decided to take a small detour back to another key frontier: recurrence.

Up to this point, I had the **accepting recurrence payment flow** fully
outlined, both in theory and in practice. There are still some small kinks to
iron out, but I realized it makes more sense to address those after the other
half — the **sending recurrence flow** — comes into place.

So today was about exactly that: designing the path forward for sending
recurrent payments.  
A calm, steady day of progress — and a satisfying one.

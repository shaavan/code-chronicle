# Log 162: The Final Sweep

> 29 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Addressed](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2920137218)
  the final batch of `Flow` suggestions
- Worked through new suggestions on `Dummy Hops`
  ([progress here](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/dummy-10))

## Reflections:

Today was a day of focused sprinting — Flow in the morning, Dummy Hops in the
afternoon.

With Flow, I addressed the last round of suggestions. It’s nearly there now —
after weeks of work, feedback, and polishing, it’s ready to stand on its own.
Closing this loop feels quietly monumental.

On the Dummy Hops front, I dug into a subtle but important suggestion: we likely
**don’t need to authenticate every dummy hop**, just the first one. If the first
hop is authenticated, we can safely assume the blinded path was constructed by
us, and skip redundant checks for subsequent hops. It’s a nuanced but elegant
optimization.

I’ll be testing this idea out tomorrow — looking forward to seeing it take shape
in code.

A day of closure and new edge cases. Just how I like it.

# Weekly Log 31: _Refinements and Milestones_

> 24 July 2025 – 29 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Finished & Merged](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246#issuecomment-3113189198)
  the **No Blinded Path Offer** branch
- [Addressed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-19)
  mentor feedback on the **Event Model** design, refining both trait structure
  and flow logic
- [Opened](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3964) a new PR
  to introduce compile-time checks for `VerifiedInvoiceRequest<S>`
- [Updated](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/dummy-22) the
  **Dummy Hops** branch based on peer suggestions to enhance correctness and
  polish
- [Refined](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-22) the
  new event model logic based on post-discussion feedback
- Celebrated a quiet but meaningful milestone — **Log 200**

## Reflections:

This stretch of days brought steady progress, graceful finishes, and quiet
fulfillment.

Rebasing older branches into the new async architecture felt like restoring
bridges — carefully updating past work while preserving the essence that made it
function well. The Dummy Hops logic received its layer of finesse, while the No
Blinded Path Offer was brought back into alignment after recent structural
changes.

The `VerifiedInvoiceRequest<S>` PR felt especially satisfying — not just for the
compile-time guarantees it introduced, but for the new foundations it lays for a
cleaner event model and flexible currency handling.

And then came Log 200.

It’s easy to overlook numbers. But this one felt like a small ceremony — a
marker along the trail, looking back over a path of persistent effort, quiet
clarity, and steady care. Each log a step. And now, two hundred of them.

The code moved forward. And with it, so did I.

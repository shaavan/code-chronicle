# Log 58: "A Fresh Start"

> 01 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated the
  [currency](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-12)
  handling approach following feedback from my mentor.

## Reflections:

Kicking off the New Year with productive energy! Based on feedback from my
mentor, I
[updated](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-12) the
currency approach to introduce two separate traitsâ€”one dedicated to currency
conversion and another for analyzing the received `InvoiceRequest` and `Invoice`
more generally.

This change introduces a clean separation of responsibilities, making the
implementation simpler and more intuitive for users who only want to add
currency support without diving into general assessors. Another task checked
off!

Wishing everyone a Happy New Year! May this year bring joy, warmth, and peace to
all. ðŸŽ‰

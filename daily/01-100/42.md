  CI.

## Reflections:

In a complete shift from yesterday’s slower pace, I challenged myself to solve a
new issue as quickly as possible. To my surprise and delight, I not only created
a PR but also received an
"[LGTM](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3458#pullrequestreview-2495727119)"
on the same day!

The thrill of tackling and resolving challenges quickly was invigorating, and
I’m excited to take on more fast-paced challenges in the future. Here’s to a
future full of challenges and victories!

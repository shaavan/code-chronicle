## Reflections:

An interesting day—and one that reminded me: it's usually easier than we think
to look a challenge in the eye, no matter how intimidating it appears on the
surface.

Today, I sat down to finally address a set of recommendations I’d been dreading
for a while:

- First, to expand test coverage for the `Event` enum (the **largest enum** in
  the codebase) to ensure every field of every variant is properly written and
  read.
- Second, to confirm that the `PaymentClaimable` event properly supports
  multiple channels in the case of multi-part payments. Initially, this seemed
  like it would require implementing an MPP payment and claim flow from
  scratch—_yikes_.

But then I gave it another round of effort, bracing for impact—and it clicked.

For the first, I realized I didn’t need a massive, all-encompassing test suite.
I could simply check serialization/deserialization **at the point where each
event is generated and extracted**. That turned what I thought was a massive
task into a clean, two-line solution.

And for the second—I figured if MPP tests already existed, they likely _already_
generated `PaymentClaimable` events involving multiple channels. All I had to do
was confirm that—and to my sweet surprise, it was true. So no extra
implementation needed—just a graceful
[acknowledgment](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655#discussion_r2052546531)
of the discovery.

Oh, what a humbling day of crucial lessons.  
With the eyes of clarity and presence, all fear and challenge dissolve.  
And then whatever remains no longer feels like a challenge—it simply becomes
part of the journey.

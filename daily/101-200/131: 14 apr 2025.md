# Log 131: "Sculpting Flow"

> 14 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Implemented](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-15) Flow
  recommendations.

## Reflections:

Oooof! A day of hard work brought to completion!  
Today was a day **dedicated to Flow**â€”and oh boy, what a day.

There were three big tasks lined up:

1. **Integrate `MessageRouter` and `Router`** into Flow in a clean, logical
   fashion.
2. **Move context secret creation** out of `ChannelManager` and into Flow.
3. And the **biggest of all**â€”**remove the Flow trait** entirely.

Working through them one by one, solving first, tackling next, I realized what a
**beast of code** Iâ€™m playing with here. And today, I gave it the **respect it
deserved**â€”not cutting corners, not joking around, but getting it _prepared_,
getting it _chiseled_, for review and, hopefully soon, for merge.

Today was one of those rare days where you stand before a block of stone with
nothing but a chiselâ€”and with each hit, **something beautiful starts to
emerge**.  
A beautiful day, being the sculptor of the digital realm. ðŸª¨ðŸ’»âœ¨

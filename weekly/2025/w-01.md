# Week 01: "Wrapping Up, Gearing Up"

> Week of 30 Dec 2024 - 3 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week marked a blend of wrapping up previous discussions, tackling assigned
issues, and kicking off the New Year with tangible progress. Here’s an overview
of the key highlights:

- **Updating Offer Builders**: Implemented changes to reintroduce the default
  `create_{offer, refund}_builder` in the Offers flow, enabling users to use the
  default router while retaining flexibility for custom implementations.

- **Currency and Flexibility**: Updated the
  [currency approach](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-12)
  to split responsibilities into two distinct traits: one for currency
  conversion and another for generalized assessment of `InvoiceRequest` and
  `Invoice`. This change enhanced flexibility and usability for developers.

- **Progress on
  [#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320)**:
  Revisited the challenge of completing payments in locked HTLCs with closed
  channels. This time, a structured approach to understanding the problem
  yielded a working test—though not yet fully resolved, it’s 90% there.

- **Addressing Test Utilities
  [#3381](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3381)**:
  Opened a [PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3504) to
  improve test utilities, ensuring no dangling RAA blockers are left at the end
  of tests. The task, while initially daunting, was completed within a day,
  showcasing the value of methodical problem-solving.

## Reflections:

This week felt like a harmonious mix of closure and new beginnings. Finalizing
updates to Offers and currency handling tied up discussions from the past few
weeks, while diving into new challenges, like
[#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320) and
[#3381](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3381), brought
fresh energy to my workflow.

What stood out this week was the importance of thoughtful preparation. Taking
time to thoroughly understand problems, as with
[#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320), often
made solutions more tangible and effective. Similarly, focusing on simplifying
implementations, like splitting currency handling into separate traits,
reflected the value of clean design and usability.

This week closes out the year-end discussions and kicks off the New Year with
momentum. Here's to more learning, challenges, and accomplishments in the weeks
ahead!

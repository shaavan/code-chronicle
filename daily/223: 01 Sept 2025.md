# Log 223: The Weight of the Simple

> 01 Sept 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] with PoC implementation of [recurrence].

## Reflections

Today’s challenge came not from complexity, but from simplicity with hidden
depth: introducing new primitives for the recurrence PoC.

Some fields in the recurrence spec must be non-zero, so using `NonZeroU32`
seemed like the right call. But I quickly realized that this type hadn’t been
used in the codebase before. That meant I had to define everything from
scratch—`Writeable`, `Readable`, and all the serialization logic I usually take
for granted.

It was a small but meaningful reminder: even the most “basic” types don’t just
plug in and work. Someone always lays the groundwork.

A quiet day, and a good one for learning.

# Log 141: "Investigating Dummies"

> 28 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed
  [#3655](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655#issuecomment-2835192427)
  review comments.
- Discussed new Dummy Hops approach and its issues with a peer.

## Reflections:

After addressing the latest updates for #3655 (focused on improving tests), I
shifted gears to tackle the problem with the **new Dummy Hops approach**.

During a discussion with my colleague, they suggested that **dummy hop parsing**
might be failing due to **mismatched Shared Secrets** between encryption and
decryption.

Intrigued, I dove into the investigation.

To my surprise, I found that the **Shared Secret values matched perfectly** on
both the encrypting and decrypting sides. Still, dummy hop decoding kept
failing.

Here‚Äôs the interesting part‚Äîwhen I removed the dummy hops and used just a
**vanilla blinded path**, everything worked flawlessly, even though the **same
sets of Shared Secrets** were used.

I‚Äôve now shared these findings with my colleague, and I‚Äôm looking forward to
hearing their thoughts on **why** this discrepancy is happening.

The investigation continues‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs getting exciting! üßê

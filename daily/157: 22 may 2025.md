  [latest suggestions](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-40)

## Reflections:

After taking a day off to recover from a bout of flu, I decided to ease back
into the rhythm — not to push too hard, but just enough to keep the momentum
alive.

Today was a quiet one. I spent time addressing the most recent set of
suggestions on the Flow branch. Small steps, but forward nonetheless.

Illness has a way of putting things in perspective. Even the simplest tasks feel
heavier when your body isn’t at its best. And in that struggle, there’s a quiet
reminder: that health — the ease of being able to move, think, and create — is a
silent blessing we often overlook.

I know once I’m back to full strength, this moment will stay with me. A soft
reminder to be grateful — for this body, this breath, this spirit.

Wishing myself (and all reading this) the best of health. :)

# Log 260: Remembering Elegance

## What I Worked On

- [Solved] another layer of the problem with **Payment Dummy Hops**.

## Reflections

After days of staring at the problem from every angle, I finally found such an
elegant solution to the `intro_node_blinding_point` issue that I’m genuinely
proud of it.

Here’s the context: when the **payee** itself is the **introduction node**, the
`intro_node_blinding_point` was being incorrectly assigned to the dummy hops
preceding it. The challenge was to preserve information about the
`intro_node_blinding_point` — without leaking any structural hints to the
counterparty or creating unnecessary memory overhead for the node.

The insight was simple but powerful:  
what if the `ReceiveTlvs` we generate as part of the blinded payment path
_carried_ the `intro_node_blinding_point` within them?  
That way, even if dummy hops are in use, the `ReceiveTlvs` would “remember” the
correct blinding point — ensuring it’s available when decrypting the
corresponding inbound onion payload.

Once I implemented this, everything just clicked. The code worked exactly as
intended.  
A clean, satisfying victory — the kind that makes all the debugging worth it.

# Log 295: Proof over Concept

## What I Worked On

- [Progressed] on the payer flow implementation

## Reflections

Today turned out to be an important turning point for the **payer flow**.

Last time I worked on this, I was stuck at a crossroads around introducing an
explicit signing public key. The core question lingered: how do we ensure an
identical signing public key across all recurrence requests? Doing so would
imply a stable signing keypair — but where should that come from? Should it be
derived deterministically, or should it be the user’s responsibility to store
and manage it through their `NodeSigner` implementation?

Too many questions were left hanging the last time I was here.

Today, while revisiting the flow end-to-end, one thing became clear: we’re still
firmly in the **proof-of-concept stage** for recurrence. At this point, it’s
more valuable to have a working, end-to-end prototype than a perfectly polished
abstraction with nothing concrete to demonstrate.

So I made a pragmatic call.

For now, I’m taking the simplest viable approach — clearly documented as such —
by storing a `KeyPair` directly alongside the `RecurrenceId` in
`OutboundRecurrenceData` within `ChannelManager`. It’s not the final design, but
it’s sufficient for validating the flow and unblocking progress.

With that decision made, I was able to move forward with the implementation
today. A working, prototypical draft of the payer flow now feels within reach
again.

The journey continues — and it feels exciting again.

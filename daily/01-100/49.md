# Log 49: "Tracking Down the Cause"

> 19 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Investigated and worked on solving
  [#3090](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3090).

## Reflections:

Today, I focused on tackling
[#3090](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3090), which
described an error case where the counterparty wasn’t informed of its
generation, leading to a poor UX.

After diving into the issue and tracing its source, I realized it wasn’t caused
by the LDK codebase. To confirm, I wrote a test simulating the scenario
described in the issue and shared it with the author for validation.

I believe the issue is nearly resolved, but I’ll wait for the author’s feedback
to ensure it’s fully addressed. It felt good to get this one sorted—another step
forward!

# Log 83: "Deep Dives & Eurekas"

> 04 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Reviewed [#3579](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3579).
- Discussed **Payment Notification** & **OffersMessageFlow** with my mentor.

## Reflections:

The day was split into two distinct but equally engaging halves.

In the **first half**, I reviewed a PR aimed at allowing `LengthReadable` to be
properly read. The challenge here was that `LengthReadable`, being a more
specific trait, lacked a `read` function. Some structsâ€”like the inner onion
packet for **Trampoline**â€”only implement `LengthReadable`, making this a crucial
fix. This review took me through a deep dive into the difference between
`Readable` & `LengthReadable`, as well as how the `read` macros operate. A fun
and insightful ride!

The **second half** was even more exciting! I had a **detailed discussion with
my mentor** on the **Payment Notification system**, where we explored different
approaches and the reasoning behind selecting one over another. The conversation
provided some great insights into decision-making at a systems level.

Finally, we shifted our focus to `OffersMessageFlow`, discussing **how to
maintain a clean separation** between:

1. **Onion message communication** (handled in `flow.rs`).
2. **Subsequent payment processing** (handled in `ChannelManager`).

That discussion led to some _eureka moments_, and Iâ€™m super excited to implement
these ideas in the coming days! ðŸš€

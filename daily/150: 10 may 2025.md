# Log 150: "Problem Solved!"

> 10 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated Flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2868765098),
  resolving the test failure discovered yesterday.

## Reflections:

After discussing the issue with my mentor yesterday, I got some helpful leads on
what might be causing the test failure.

Digging deeper, I realized the root cause: we weren’t updating Flow’s
`highest_seen_timestamp` when `ChannelManager`’s timestamp advanced. This
desynchronization was likely the source of the failure.

After experimenting with a few ideas, a simple solution emerged: just call
Flow’s update method from `ChannelManager` whenever the timestamp updates. I
implemented it—and the problem vanished.

Even better, I noticed that since Flow no longer directly uses the
`EntropySource` in its constructor, an older test issue has also quietly
disappeared. It’s no longer blocking us.

With this, I genuinely feel like **Flow is now in its final stage**—ready for
review and (hopefully) merge. Looking forward to the big day… but for now, I’m
raising a toast to today’s win. 🍻

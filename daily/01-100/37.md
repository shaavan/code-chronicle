# Log 37: "Fixing the CI"

> 5 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Worked on fixing the CI for
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/44a06195007fe1605b3f93c6e99d16b69295f9bb).

## Reflections:

After addressing the suggestions yesterday, I focused on fixing the CI before
pushing the updated branch. While I made good progress, there are still a few
issues to resolve before all the CI failures are cleared.

Iâ€™m optimistic about completing them early tomorrow!  
Closing the book on a beautiful day, and opening the book of another beautiful
day ahead.

# Log 135: "Of Gratitude & Curiosities"

> 18 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Submitted the **Q4 report** after discussion with mentor.
- Rebased
  [Flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639#issuecomment-2815558799)
  on latest `main`.

## Reflections:

After reviewing my progress report with my mentor, I finally felt confident
enough to submit it. Hearing that he was **genuinely impressed** with the work
and the clarity of the report made me feel incredibly grateful. Honestly, none
of it wouldâ€™ve been possible without his supportâ€”through both the high tides and
the stuck moments.

With the report submitted, I turned back to the **Flow** PR. Interestingly,
after rebasing, one of the **new tests in the codebase started failing**, even
though we haven't yet used the `flow` field in `ChannelManager`. The failure
isnâ€™t due to broken logicâ€”just the presence of the field! A very subtle, very
curious case.

And thatâ€™s what excites me mostâ€”**tomorrow, I get to chase down a weird little
bug and come out knowing something I didnâ€™t know today**.

A great day finished. A greater one waiting on the other side. ðŸš€

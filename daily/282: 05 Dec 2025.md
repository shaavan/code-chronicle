## What I Worked On

- [Opened] review PR for introducing custom TLVs in the payment flow

## Reflections

Today, I wrapped up the first version of custom TLV support in the payment flow.

While working through the BOLT12 implementation, I noticed that our existing
helper method for BOLT11 payments (`pay_for_bolt11_invoice`) also lacked support
for setting `custom_tlvs`. This wasn’t part of the original scope my mentor
suggested — but it felt like a natural and necessary extension.

So, I expanded the PR to cover both BOLT12 and BOLT11 flows. The result is a
more complete and consistent TLV experience across payment types.

The initial review PR is now up for a pass from **coderabbit** before I do a
final cleanup and open the main pull request tomorrow.

A good day of shipping clean, forward-compatible improvements.

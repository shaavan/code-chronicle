# Log 01: "Downgrade support & Meticulous Preparation"

> 22 Oct 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Corrected downgrade support in
  [#3342](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342). Itâ€™s a
  crucial fix! You can find more details
  [here](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342#issuecomment-2429104842).
- Updated the [Code Chronicle](https://github.com/shaavan/code-chronicle/pull/4)
  to auto-correct formatting whenever a new file is committed (because why not
  keep things neat, right?).

## Reflections:

Today was full of learnings! One big takeaway was understanding
[how to handle downgrade support](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3342#discussion_r1809604888).
I also realized that I canâ€™t help but organize everything _just right_ before I
start writing a single line of text. Setting up this repo has been a process,
but I would be lying if I say I didn't enjoy it! ðŸš€

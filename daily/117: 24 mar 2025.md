# Log 117: "A Day of Priorities, Reviews, and Tea"

> 24 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Reviewed [#3674](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3674)

## Reflections:

Today was a gentle return to momentum after the restful weekend. I spent time
easing back into the groove by picking up some open reviews‚Äîstarting with
[#3674](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3674).

The PR was fairly straightforward‚Äîit introduced a test case to ensure that
splicing fails gracefully when the provided funding is insufficient for channel
creation. The test looked functionally sound, but I suggested a few minor
writing improvements to enhance its clarity and readability.

With the review done, I took some quiet time to reflect and map out priorities
for the upcoming days. A restful, meaningful day‚Äîbalanced by thoughtful work,
forward planning, and of course, a warm cup of tea. üçµ

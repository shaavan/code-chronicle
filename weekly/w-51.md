# Weekly Summary: "Milestones and Momentum"

> Week of 16 Dec 2024 - 20 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

This week was filled with progress, collaboration, and a significant milestone.
Here’s a breakdown of the key highlights:

- **Advancing Async BOLT12 Message Support**: I focused on refining and
  implementing the approach for asynchronous BOLT12 message handling in
  [#3318](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3318). The new
  trait introduces flexibility, allowing users to handle onion messages
  asynchronously while maintaining a default synchronous implementation.

- **Joining the Lightning Dev Kit Team**: A personal highlight this week was
  being made a member of the
  [Lightning Dev Kit](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/) repository! This
  recognition felt like a significant milestone, celebrating the efforts and
  contributions I’ve made so far.

- **Addressing Issues**: I tackled
  [#3090](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3090),
  investigating an error case affecting counterparty communication. While the
  issue wasn’t caused by the LDK codebase, I created a test simulating the
  scenario and shared it with the author for validation.

- **Currency Support for Offers**: I began updating the
  [approach](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/invreqevent-8)
  for asynchronous BOLT12 messages to also handle currency support for Offers.
  This dual-purpose solution not only streamlines the implementation but also
  sets the foundation for further enhancements in the LDK codebase.

- **50 Logs Milestone**: This week marked the 50th entry in my _Code Chronicle_.
  Reflecting on this process, I’m proud of the consistency and value it has
  brought to my work and growth.

## Reflections:

This week was a blend of technical progress and personal milestones. Advancing
the async BOLT12 message support and solving multiple problems with one approach
felt like a significant achievement. Joining the LDK team was an incredible
moment, recognizing the effort and passion I’ve poured into this project.

Reaching 50 logs also gave me a chance to reflect on how far I’ve come. This
process of documenting my journey has been a rewarding and motivating practice,
one I look forward to continuing.

Here’s to more milestones, meaningful work, and continued growth in the weeks
ahead!

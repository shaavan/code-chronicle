## Reflections

Life handed me a curious little lesson today—one that started with a harmless
thought: _“Let me just take a quick look.”_

While I made more headway on the recurrence PoC, the real moment of the day came
while reviewing a small, seemingly innocuous PR. The proposal was simple: to
randomize the output of a function, just convert a `Vec` to a `HashMap` and back
to a `Vec`. Easy, dependency-free randomness. Right?

But looking closer, I fell into a rabbit hole.

Randomness isn’t just chaos—it’s _structured unpredictability_. It’s disorder
born of deterministic seeds. It’s not enough for outputs to _look_ random; the
process has to actually provide unpredictability. That’s what makes it reliable.

Ironically, randomness turns out to be one of the most misunderstood tools in
software. To create it properly, you have to first admit: there’s no such thing
as randomness without context. A black box isn’t random just because we don’t
understand it. In fact, it might be worse than pseudorandomness—because we can’t
reason about it.

That realization hit harder than expected. A 7-line PR turned into a meditation
on patterns, entropy, and control. A reminder that even in code, the illusion of
chaos often masks a deeply structured universe.

Wild where curiosity can take you.

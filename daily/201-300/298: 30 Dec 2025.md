# Log 298: Closing the Loop

> 30 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Fixed] invoice handling issues in the payer flow
- [Addressed] reviewer suggestions for dummy hops

## Reflections

Today was a good day.

I started by fixing a few issues in the **payer flow’s invoice handling**.
Invoice handling requires access to the payer signing public key, and after the
recent changes to outbound recurrence session data, that access was no longer
direct.

The first task, then, was to restore clean access to the payer signing public
key. In doing so, this also became a useful safety check: ensuring that the
keypair derived from the recurrence session data always resolves to the
originally stored signing public key.

With that sorted, I moved on to addressing the final set of **dummy hops**
suggestions — thoughtfully provided by a senior reviewer, even during the
holiday period. I’m genuinely grateful for that level of care and engagement.

As the year draws to a close, it’s hard not to reflect a bit. And honestly —
what a year it’s been.

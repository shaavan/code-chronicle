# Log 111: "Towards a Cleaner Flow"

> 13 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated [#3655](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655)
  and [#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658),
  addressing review comments.
- Worked on the new Flow
  [updates](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/flow-07).

## Reflections:

After addressing another round of review comments on two of my recent PRs, I
spent the rest of the day revisiting the suggestions my mentor and I discussed
earlier this week regarding the **Flow** branch.

The focus this time: **decoupling `OffersMessageFlow` from the responsibility of
handling `MessageRouter`.**  
Instead, the new design passes the **blinded path creation function as a
closure** to the Flow. This way, Flow simply **orchestrates the usage of this
function**, invoking it at appropriate moments within its internal operations.

The benefits are twofold:

- It allows users to **keep their `MessageRouter` (and `Router`) usage
  centralized within `ChannelManager`**, maintaining a single source of truth.
- At the same time, it provides **flexibility for those not using
  `ChannelManager`**, as they no longer need to rely on a particular style of
  `MessageRouter` implementation to work with `OffersMessageFlow`.

The new direction feels promising, and Iâ€™m excited to see how it plays out in
practice!

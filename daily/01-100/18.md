# Log 18: "OffersMessageFlow Continued"

> 13 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed the feedback from yesterday’s discussion.

## Reflections:

Amidst a day filled with preparation for upcoming travel, I managed to carve out
quality time for work. I was able to implement most of my mentor’s suggestions,
bringing the branch closer to its final version.

`OffersMessageFlow` has been the most ambitious project I’ve taken on in my
journey with Lightning, and it’s incredibly satisfying to see it finally
becoming what it was meant to be!

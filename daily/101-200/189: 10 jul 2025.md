# Log 189: _A Day in the Name of Love_

> 10 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/3845-mac-5) the
  `ReceiveAuthKey` PR based on review suggestions

## Reflections:

Today was a race between two selves, the personal and the professional.  
The first half of the day was spent tying up loose ends for something close to
the heart,  
while the other half was me sprinting toward a goal I had set for myself at
work.

It ended with me pushing code literally at the stroke of midnight.  
And oddly, that felt... good.

Days like this remind me of the love I live: love for the life I’m building,  
and love for the work I do. I could’ve chosen to rest, but I chose to show up,
for a single reason. because I care.  
And that's a love worth honouring.

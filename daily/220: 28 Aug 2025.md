# Log 220: On Foundations

> 28 August 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Updated] Dummy Hops PR
- Researched internals of LDK Node

## Reflections

Today reminded me of the value of thoughtfulness over hurried output.

The task seemed simple on paper: expand the test coverage for dummy hops to
ensure all created blinded paths are of equal length. But in practice, every
line felt like a decision point. Do we use a basic conditional, or opt for a
more idiomatic `map`? Should the implementation prioritize conciseness, or lean
toward readability?

Even on the testing side, the same tension emerged:  
Do we create a dedicated test for this logic, or integrate the check into the
shared test utility so that all related tests benefit?

These are the kinds of decisions that quietly shape the future of a codebase.
Once made, they tend to become invisible assumptions—hard to reverse,
foundational in impact.

And that’s exactly why I’ve come to respect not just the code I write, but the
_intent_ behind it.  
Every line carries weight. Every shortcut has a cost. An important reminder—and
one I’ll carry forward.

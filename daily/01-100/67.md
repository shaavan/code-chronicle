# Log 67: "Rebuilding the Base"

> 13 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed
  [suggestions](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830#discussion_r1910694902)
  on the
  [Custom TLVs](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830) PR.

## Reflections:

Today, I focused on addressing comments and suggestions on the Custom TLVs PR.
After rebasing the branch, I noticed that some tests were failing. To ensure a
clean slate, I decided to rebuild the branch from scratch, updating it with
proper atomic divisions as I progressed.

While the process was tiring, it felt rewarding to lay a solid foundation for
the remaining suggestions. With this base in place, Iâ€™m optimistic about
tackling the remaining feedback tomorrow.

Hereâ€™s to a restful night and a productive day ahead! ðŸŒŸ

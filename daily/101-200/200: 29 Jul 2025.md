# Log 200: _Two Hundred Steps_

> 29 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Addressed](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3726#issuecomment-3132617334)
  Dummy Hops suggestions
- [Refined](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-22) the
  event model based on discussion with mentor

## Reflections:

Today marks a special moment — the 200th step in this journey of code
chronicles.

What began as a quiet habit has now become a thread running through months of
learning, effort, and growth. One step at a time, and here we are. A small
milestone, maybe — but one I feel deeply grateful for.

As for the work itself, it followed the same spirit: steady refinement,
thoughtful feedback, and moving closer to completing two pieces that matter to
me.

A meaningful day — for the code, and the journey it's part of.

# Week 19: "Closures and New Currents"

> 01 May – 06 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- ✅ **Closed PR #3655**: Finalized the long-running PR introducing
  `inbound_channel_ids` in `PaymentClaimable`, complete with extended test
  coverage and peer-reviewed updates.
- 🧩 **Investigated & resolved Dummy TLV decoding issues**: Identified and fixed
  incorrect decoding logic in `ControlTlvs`, with valuable peer support along
  the way.
- 🔁 **Addressed multiple Flow PR updates**: Streamlined Flow’s parameter
  handling (removing `Router`, `EntropySource` from struct state), and
  implemented dual-constructor support for `ChannelManager`.
- 💬 **Discussed No Path Offer direction**: Raised and reasoned through
  architectural concerns on #3246, offering alternative suggestions, validated
  by mentor feedback.
- 🌱 **Explored Flow follow-ups**: With mentor guidance, began charting out new
  features on top of Flow—such as event-driven asynchronous handling for BOLT12
  messages and custom currency support.

## Reflections:

This week felt like a deep exhale—the kind that comes after pushing through
complexity and surfacing with clarity. With the closing of #3655 and the Dummy
TLV breakthrough, two long-standing threads were finally resolved. That alone
brought a sense of grounded accomplishment.

Meanwhile, Flow continued to evolve—not just in implementation but in vision.
Conversations with my mentor helped shape what comes next: a more modular,
event-based system that empowers users with both **simplicity by default** and
**customizability on demand**.

From clear closures to expansive horizons—this week felt like stepping through
one door, only to find a dozen new ones waiting, wide open.

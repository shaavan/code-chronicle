# Log 109: "Let's Think It Through"

> 11 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Brainstormed and planned the next course of action for two PRs:
  [#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658) and the
  [Flow PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639).

## Reflections:

Today was a slow, methodical session of thinking things through.

I realized that the current Flow approach, as it stands, might lead to future
hiccupsâ€”either during abstraction of certain parts or when encountering edge
cases that could become unsolvable if we continue down the same path. So I
paused, took a step back, and carefully analyzed the structure and design
decisions.

After organizing my thoughts and making notes, I had a deep and thorough
discussion with my mentor. That conversation helped clarify a lot of the
underlying challenges and gave me a clearer direction forward.

I now feel much more grounded and confident in trying out an approach that might
actually work.

Excited to dive into it tomorrow! ðŸš€

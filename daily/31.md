# Log 31: "Preparing for Tomorrow"

> 28 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commit/a451521597310a7782d606c63632400e6d7a8ba1).
- Began preparing my proposal for next year’s project.

## Reflections:

After updating `OffersMessageFlow`, I shifted my focus to researching and
brainstorming ideas for my next year’s project. This year has been truly
wonderful, and it feels exciting to start rounding off my work as the final
quarter approaches!

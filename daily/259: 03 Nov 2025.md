# Log 259: Regaining Momentum

> 03 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Worked] on addressing [#4126] suggestions.

## Reflections

After a full week immersed in Payment Dummy Hops and Recurrence, I decided to
start this week with a steadier rhythm — giving some long-overdue attention to
my other open work.

I noticed a few pending [suggestions] on [#4126], so I spent the day reviewing
and addressing them. The process went smoothly overall, though there are still a
few final details to iron out before pushing the update — which I plan to do
tomorrow.

A calm day of quiet progress — the kind that sets the tone for the week ahead.

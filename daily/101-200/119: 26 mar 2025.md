# Log 119: "Travel, and Presentation"

> 26 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Finished preparing the Bitshala Bitcoin presentation.

## Reflections:

Today was a day of movementâ€”both physically and creatively. Between all the
travel, I carved out focused moments to work on my presentation for the upcoming
Bitshala Bitcoin event.

Iâ€™m proud of what came together. The presentation feels true to what I want to
express, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with fellow Bitcoiners in the coming days.
Hereâ€™s to showing up, both on the road and on the stage! ðŸš€

# Log 206: Recurrence Continues

> 07 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Continued studying the
  [Recurrence Spec PR](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240)

## Reflections:

The exploration of recurrence deepened today.

It was a day of peeling layers, spotting ambiguities, and letting questions
guide the way. One puzzle that held my attention was the nature of `time_unit` —
defined as an integer multiple of a base unit (e.g. 35 seconds, or 20 days), but
not supporting composite durations or fractional units like 2.5 days. That
raised a cascade of inquiries: What if a user wants to express such durations?
Is the current model expressive enough? Would a different structure — one closer
to duration trees or composed spans — be more natural?

And so the rabbit hole widened.

Honestly, I love days like this. When a single design choice becomes a window
into deeper questions — not just of syntax, but of intent, of user need, of
philosophical clarity. Sitting with a problem, circling it with curiosity,
gently looking for cracks in its apparent completeness — that’s the kind of
intellectual play that excites me most.

Tomorrow, I’ll keep going. For now, I’ll rest in the quiet thrill of a question
well-formed.

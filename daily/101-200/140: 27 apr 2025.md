# Log 140: "CI Done!"

> 27 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Fixed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3639.09) Flow CI.

## Reflections:

Finally, on a quite productive weekend, I focused on finishing a daunting task
at handâ€”**getting Flow CI fixed**.

The task, though sounding small, was really a **game of patience**â€”sitting with
each commit, testing, testing again, watching CI fail, tweaking, retrying,
repeatingâ€¦ **until success**.

And when it finally clicked? Oh, the joy of seeing those **green CI checks** on
Flowâ€”_chefâ€™s kiss_.

A good end to a good weekend! ðŸ’š

# Log 110: "Updates on the Way!"

> 12 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated [#3655](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3655)
  and [#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658),
  addressing review comments.

## Reflections:

Today turned out to be quite a productive one!

Following yesterday’s discussion, I focused on incorporating feedback for two of
my new PRs.

The first update was for [#3655], where the suggestion was to use
`Vec<ChannelId>` instead of `Vec<Option<ChannelId>>`. It made perfect
sense—since an empty vector already captures the intent of “no channels,”
there’s no need to wrap elements in `Option`. So that was the first thing I
tackled.

The second PR update, [#3658], was particularly fun. I received a great
suggestion—rather than checking if an `InvoiceReceived` event already exists in
the queue, we could instead **update the outbound payment status as soon as the
invoice is received**. Not only does this make the solution cleaner, but it also
improves clarity and idempotency.

A solid day of thoughtful improvements—loving the momentum! 🚀

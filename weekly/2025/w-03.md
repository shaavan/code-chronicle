# Week 03: "Persistence & Progress"

> Week of 11 Jan 2025 â€“ 16 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was a journey of persistence, progress, and overcoming obstacles, both
technical and personal. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key accomplishments:

- **Finalizing the Currency PR**: I introduced the
  [Currency PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3525),
  encapsulating days of effort and insightful feedback from my mentor.

- **Advancing Offers with No Blinded Path**: I made significant progress with
  the
  [No Path Offer implementation](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3246.16),
  refining its approach to align with user needs and enhancing overall
  functionality.

- **Addressing Feedback on Custom TLVs**: The
  [Custom TLVs](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2830) PR
  saw substantial updates this week. I restructured and rebased the branch,
  addressed comments, fixed tests, and resolved CI issues to prepare it for
  final submission.

- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Engaged in discussions with my mentor,
  aligning on improvements and brainstorming ideas to simplify and refine
  various implementations.

## Reflections:

This week was both rewarding and challenging. It was marked by moments of
growth, from incorporating feedback into PRs to overcoming the fatigue of being
under the weather. Each update, each fix, and every discussion brought clarity
and a sense of accomplishment.

The culmination of the Custom TLVs PR was particularly satisfyingâ€”itâ€™s a
testament to the persistence and care needed to create meaningful work. Pushing
through illness reminded me of the value of consistency and the importance of
pacing oneself.

As I wrap up this week, I feel proud of the progress made and grateful for the
guidance and collaboration that shaped these achievements. Hereâ€™s to more
learning, building, and overcoming in the days ahead! ðŸš€

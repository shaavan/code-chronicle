# Log 62: "Momentum and Mentorship"

> 07 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Made further progress on
  [#3381](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3381) (part
  2).
- Discussed improvement points and other PRs with my mentor.

## Reflections:

After making another step forward on
[#3381](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3381), I had an
in-depth and fruitful discussion with my mentor. We explored ideas for tackling
upcoming tasks in the next quarter, as well as thoughts on current PRs and
potential experiments to refine them further.

The discussion provided valuable insights and clarity, and Iâ€™m feeling energized
to implement these ideas in the coming days. Excited for whatâ€™s ahead! ðŸš€

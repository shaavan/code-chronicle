# Log 101: "Ideas to Action"

> 28 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Updated](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3617.04)
  **Bolt11 Payment Flow**, addressing suggestions.
- Worked on the **alternate OffersMessageFlow approach**.

## Reflections:

First off, I focused on pushing a near-complete PR across the finish
line—**updating the Bolt11 Payment Flow** based on the latest suggestions. The
time was well spent, and I believe the PR is finally complete.

Next, I shifted gears to **brainstorming the alternate event-based
OffersMessageFlow approach**. After getting some
[clarification](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3412#discussion_r1974441264)
from Matt following yesterday’s discussion, I was able to form a clearer picture
of how the new approach might look in practice.

With a solid conceptual grasp, I moved on to implementing a **proof of
concept**. The work is progressing well, and I plan to spend the rest of today
deepening my practical understanding of the approach.

Now, back to work! 👨‍💻🚀

# Log 86: "Restructuring Continues"

> 08 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Continued restructuring the
  [`Flow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/omf-30) to make
  commits more manageable.

## Reflections:

On this beautiful weekend, I continued refining the structure of `Flow`,
focusing on breaking down changes into **cleaner, more logical commits**. The
process has been **smooth and rewarding**, and Iâ€™m now **halfway through the
restructuring**.

It was a **joyful experience** revisiting each part of `Flow`, **analyzing its
intricacies**, and figuring out the best way to **arrange changes into a
cohesive, progressive narrative**. There's something deeply satisfying about
**bringing order to complexity**â€”it makes the end result **more readable,
maintainable, and intuitive**.

Another fulfilling chapter in this journey. Looking forward to completing this
soon! ðŸš€

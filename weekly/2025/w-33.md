# Weekly Log 33: Refinements & Recognition

> 07 Aug 2025 – 12 Aug 2025

## Highlights of the Week

- Wrapped up updates to the dummy hop handling logic in [#3726], bringing the
  work close to finalisation.
- Explored deeper into the [currency] PR, refining parameterisation and backend
  responsibilities.
- Rolled out and tested improvements to message routing for Offers, ensuring
  better flexibility without sacrificing reliability.
- Received direct, encouraging feedback from my mentor for a proposed design
  approach — a welcome morale boost in the middle of technical deep dives.

## Reflections

This week felt like both a sprint and a refinement period. The dummy hop
adjustments were satisfying to close in on, but the real breakthrough was in
clarifying the currency conversion trait design. Building on multiple iterations
and back-and-forth discussions, the direction now feels sharper: one trait
function for conversion, with all quantity, amount, and verification logic
shifted to the backend. The simplicity of this solution makes it both elegant
and practical — exactly the kind of balance I look for in design work.

It’s rare to get moments of verbal acknowledgement in engineering work, so my
mentor’s “great work” on that idea stood out. It was a small exchange, but it
reminded me that good ideas resonate beyond just code.

On the technical side, routing changes continue to evolve toward something more
robust, and I’m starting to see the pieces of this broader Offers work fit
together. There’s still polishing to do, but the direction is clear and
energising.

## Looking Ahead

The next stretch will be about:

- Finalising [#3726] so it’s merge-ready.
- Continuing targeted refinements to [currency].
- Testing edge cases in the new routing logic, ensuring no regressions in
  existing Offers flows.

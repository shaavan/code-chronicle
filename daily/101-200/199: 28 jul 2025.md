# Log 199: _Brick by Brick_

> 28 July 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Addressed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/dummy-22)
  suggestions on Dummy Hops
- [Worked](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/currency-22) on
  building a new event-model branch on top of
  [#3964](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3964)

## Reflections:

Today was a day of quietly building and refining the work of the past.

The first half was spent addressing suggestions on the Dummy Hops branch —
polishing out some quirks and bringing a touch of finesse to its current form.
The second half was equally satisfying, as I began setting up a fresh
event-model branch on top of `#3964`, laying the foundation for what’s to come.

A patient day, and a fulfilling one.

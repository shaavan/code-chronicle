# Log 36: "Addressing Feedback"

> 4 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Addressed feedback on
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/a1274fa368afd4894b336197ee6bef0ab1fe7c55)
  following yesterday's discussion.

## Reflections:

Building on the suggestions from yesterday’s discussion with my mentor, I
focused on implementing the feedback for `OffersMessageFlow` today. Progress is
moving along well, though there are still a few hurdles to overcome before all
the suggestions are fully addressed.

I’ll aim to carve out more time later today to push this further. ✨

**Edit:** Addressed all the
[suggestions](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/6d7c829c83f94d5ae33704fc50c48ee910aa82d7)!
Now, just one final step remains—fixing the branch before pushing it to the CI.
It feels good to have put in the extra effort today!

# Log 306: Finite, At Last

> 12 Jan 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Finished] parsing logic for payment dummy hops with finite payment relay

## Reflections

To kick off the week, I returned to the **dummy hops** work I started last week
and pushed it forward.

After unwinding a few technical knots, I was finally able to complete the
introduction of **finite payment relay values** for dummy hops. That part is now
in place and working as intended.

However, this surfaced a new challenge. The existing test framework wasn’t
designed with non-free dummy hops in mind, and as a result, several tests now
fail with an _“unexpected extra fees”_ error when dummy hops are involved.

So the next task is clear: make the test framework **dummy-hop-friendly**, with
the smallest possible set of changes — and without turning it into code
spaghetti.

That’s the challenge waiting for me tomorrow. And weirdly, I’m kind of excited
about it.

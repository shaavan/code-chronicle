# Log 176: _A Stone Lifted_

> 18 June 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Fixed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/blinded_api-17) the
  issue in the default compact path approach for No Path Offer

## Reflections:

Today was a day when **struggle met guidance**, and something finally gave way.

For the past few days, I’d been stuck on a problem in the No Path Offer branch —
specifically while updating it to make **compact blinded paths the default**.
The change worked in principle, but one of the tests began failing. The reason?
The test setup lacked a `NetworkGraph`, so it couldn’t resolve the
**introduction node** from the compact path.

My first instinct was to fix it head-on — include a `NetworkGraph` in the test,
simulate the resolution. But that approach dragged on, and I found myself stuck,
unable to break through the complexity.

Then came a simple but pivotal shift — after a short discussion with my mentor,
I looked at it differently:  
What if the test didn’t need to resolve compact paths at all?  
What if I could simply configure the test node to create **full-length (NodeId)
blinded paths**?

That change bypassed the entire resolution problem — and just like that, the
issue dissolved.

It was a small moment, but a powerful one. A reminder that sometimes, the
solution isn’t in digging harder — it’s in **looking from a new angle**.

A stone lifted. A path cleared.

# Log 325: Let's Test It

> 13 Feb 2026

## What I Worked On

- [Implemented] currency support tests

## Reflections

Today was a shorter workday due to personal commitments, but I was still able to
get some good work in.

I implemented the core tests for currency support, grounding the recent
architectural changes in executable validation. With the test coverage now in
place, there are just a few remaining areas that need polish before the branch
is ready to publish.

Looking forward to tightening those edges over the weekend.

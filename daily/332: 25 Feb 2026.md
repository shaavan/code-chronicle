## What I Worked On

- [Completed] the dummy skimmed fees support for `PaymentClaimable` and
  `PaymentClaimed`

## Reflections

Following the earlier discussion with my mentor and getting a clear go-ahead on
the direction, I focused today on finishing the implementation for exposing
dummy skimmed fees to users.

The work brings together the earlier design decisions around dummy hops and
makes the UX side concrete: users can now see how much fee was skimmed by dummy
hops through `PaymentClaimable` and `PaymentClaimed` events. With the core
approach in place, the design feels complete and internally consistent.

What remains now is refinement work — cleaning up the implementation, updating
documentation, and expanding the test coverage to ensure skimmed fees are
correctly accounted for under different scenarios.

The main piece is done. The rest is polish.

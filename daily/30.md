# Log 30: "Refining the Giant"

> 27 Nov 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/1eb9559072567f8a1f295abc0e74d7d556f8a89d)
  by cleaning it up and properly moving relevant functions.

## Reflections:

Back to my dear giant! Today, I worked on addressing feedback for
`OffersMessageFlow` from my mentor after our discussion yesterday. I focused on
moving functions that are only used in `flow.rs` directly into `flow.rs`, rather
than accessing them through the `OffersMessageCommons` trait.

Iâ€™m happy with the progress I made today and excited to keep refining
`OffersMessageFlow` tomorrow, bringing it even closer to completion.

Also, today marks one month of logging my progress on this dream project! Iâ€™m
proud of myself for sticking with it. Hereâ€™s to many more logs and progress
ahead! ðŸš€

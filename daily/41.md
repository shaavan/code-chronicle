# Log 41: "Rhythm of Work & Life"

> 10 Dec 2024

## What I Worked On:

- Updated
  [`Custom TLVs`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr2830.10).

## Reflections:

Today was a slower, more preparatory day. I made some updates to an older
[PR](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr2830.10) and engaged in
discussions about the work that lies ahead in the coming days.

I appreciate how slower days offer the space to contemplate and plan, while
faster days bring the thrill of accomplishment. As in work, so in lifeâ€”both have
their place and value.

# Log 72: "Polishing the Edges"

> 20 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated [Padding](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3177.29)
  and [i3381a](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3504.04).

## Reflections:

Today was all about refining and updating my PRs, ensuring they align with the
latest suggestions and are cleanly prepared for merging. Both branches are now
in much better shape, and Iâ€™m optimistic about seeing them merged into the
codebase soon.

Itâ€™s satisfying to revisit and polish earlier work, bringing it closer to
completion! ðŸš€

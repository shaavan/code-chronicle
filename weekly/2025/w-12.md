# Week 12: "Sharpening the Sword: Planning, Feedback & Action"

> Week of 17 March 2025 – 20 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- **Brainstormed and proposed solutions for
  [#3669](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3669)**:
  Explored ways to allow blinded path creation independent of `ChannelManager`,
  proposed a new trait-based design, and discussed it with my mentor for
  feasibility and trade-offs.
- **Flow PR Refinement**: Addressed key review suggestions and restructured
  parts of the `OffersMessageFlow` logic to decouple `MessageRouter`
  responsibility. The goal was to streamline the API surface while preserving
  flexibility for both `ChannelManager` and independent users.

- **Finalized and submitted
  [#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658)**:
  Successfully handled feedback and pushed the PR to completion—another one
  closed!

- **Bitcoin Summit Presentation Prep**: Worked on outlining content for my
  upcoming talk, refining the topics and building a base structure for the
  visual storytelling aspect of the presentation.

- **Revisited Issue
  [#3320](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/i3320b)**: Took a
  fresh, simplified approach to solving the problem by first narrowing down the
  issue and creating a more minimal test scenario to make incremental progress.

## Reflections:

This week was a **perfect blend of deep thinking, feedback-driven refinement,
and concrete progress.**  
From diving into the architectural depths of `OffersMessageFlow` to proposing
practical solutions for peer-driven blinded path creation—each step involved
sharpening understanding and structuring solutions mindfully.

What stood out most was the shift between **strategic design thinking and
hands-on execution**, especially in handling feedback gracefully and planning
for scalability. The presentation prep also brought a refreshing change of pace,
allowing me to reflect on the journey while preparing to share it.

As the week ends, it feels like I’ve **planted seeds for stronger foundations
ahead**, and I’m genuinely looking forward to the next stretch of work!

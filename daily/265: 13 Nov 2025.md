# Log 265: Completions

> 13 Nov 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Finished] [#4126].

## Reflections

Today’s focus was singular — finish what’s on the table, and do it with care.  
That focus found its shape in bringing closure to [#4126].

After a series of updates and final refinements, the work is now complete —
ready and waiting to be merged.  
It feels good to close a chapter properly, to see something through to the end
before stepping into tomorrow’s challenge.

Here’s to many more completions in the days ahead. 🥂

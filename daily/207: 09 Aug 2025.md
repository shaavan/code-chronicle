# Log 207: A Day of Scrutiny

> 07 August 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Expanded and deepened my review of the
  [Recurrence Spec PR](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1240)

## Reflections:

The journey of scrutiny continued into the deeper layers of the spec.  
My goal with this review is not just to read but to sit with each decision and
question its source.

The process is slow and sometimes leads me back to basic reasoning I may have
missed while aiming for clearer questions. But that’s exactly the kind of
attention a spec PR of this importance deserves.

I’ve chosen to walk this path with skepticism as my compass — and I’m glad to
keep moving forward with it. Each layer examined feels like another step toward
a sturdier, more thoughtful standard.

# Log 123: "Many Threads, One Direction"

> 01 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Worked on addressing suggestions on
  [#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658).
- Discussed updates and ideas on
  [Flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3639),
  [No Path Offer](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3246),
  and **Dummy Hops** with my mentor.

## Reflections:

Today was a day of **strides and progress in many directions**.

I started off by addressing review suggestions on one of my recent
PRsâ€”[#3658](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3658).
Everything went smoothly, except for one failing test that I plan to tackle
tomorrow.

After that, I shifted gears and spent time consolidating my thoughts, questions,
and open ideas around several key PRsâ€”**Flow**, **No Path Offer**, and **Dummy
Hops**. I walked through each one in detail with my mentor during our
discussion, and it proved incredibly fruitful.

The clarity I got today feels energizingâ€”I now have actionable paths forward on
all fronts.  
Excited to bring that momentum into tomorrow! ðŸš€

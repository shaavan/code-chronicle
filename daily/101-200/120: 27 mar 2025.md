# Log 120: "Let’s Get It Done"

> 27 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated the
  [No Path Offer](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3246.17)
  PR.

## Reflections:

After a lot of back-and-forth on the Flow approach, I came to a realization — it
might still take a while before we reach a final conclusion on that branch. So
today, I made a call: **undo the dependency** I had built into other PRs based
on the unmerged Flow design.

That meant a day full of **cleanup, restructuring**, and revisiting old reviews
and suggestions—this time with the clarity of hindsight. It wasn’t just
technical refactoring; it was about bridging past discussions with present
clarity, so I can carry them forward into future work.

It felt really good to pick up an important piece of work from the past and
finally **get the ball rolling again**. One step closer to completion!

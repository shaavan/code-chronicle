# Week 02: "Progress, Feedback, and Collaboration"

> Week of 06 Jan 2025 - 09 Jan 2025

## What I Worked On:

This week was marked by steady progress, meaningful feedback, and the courage to
seek collaboration when faced with challenges. Here’s a summary of the key
highlights:

- **Researching `MonitorUpdateCompletionAction`**: I dived into the codebase to
  understand how `MonitorUpdateCompletionAction::FreeOtherChannelImmediately`
  events are generated and explored ways to simulate them in a testing
  environment as part of
  [#3381](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3381). This
  laid the groundwork for a solution.

- **Mentor Discussions**: A thorough discussion with my mentor helped clarify
  priorities for the next quarter and identify key improvements for existing
  PRs. This productive session provided direction and motivation for the tasks
  ahead.

- **Simplifying Approaches**: I implemented feedback on the `No Path Offer`
  branch, simplifying the configuration parameter to a boolean and introducing a
  NULL router for scenarios without blinded paths. This improved both usability
  and code clarity.

- **Currency Handling Update**: Building on earlier feedback, I updated the
  currency handling approach by separating responsibilities into two independent
  traits: one for currency conversion and another for general `Bolt12Assessor`
  functions. This made the design cleaner and more intuitive for users.

- **Courage to Collaborate**: While tackling
  [#3320](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3320), I
  opened a PR despite the issue being unresolved. This act of collaboration
  highlighted the importance of sharing work and seeking input when stuck.

## Reflections:

This week was a blend of focused problem-solving and meaningful collaboration.
Each task underscored the value of research, thoughtful feedback, and iterative
improvements.

Opening up about challenges and seeking help felt like a tiny but significant
act of courage. It reminded me that vulnerability is often a strength,
especially in collaborative environments.

As I move forward, I feel prepared and excited to tackle the next set of
challenges with the lessons and insights gained this week. Here’s to continuing
this momentum into the weeks ahead!

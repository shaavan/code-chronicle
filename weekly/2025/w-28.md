## Reflections:

This was a short but meaningful week, one that wrapped up major arcs and opened
the path ahead.

Early in the week, I focused on bringing the `ReceiveAuthKey` PR to life.
Introducing the new key type and removing all instances of the now-redundant
`(hmac, nonce)` from the codebase made the logic not just lighter, but cleaner
and easier to follow. It felt like clearing underbrush from a trail you care
about, so others can walk it more easily.

Alongside that, I gave the final polish to the No Blinded Path Offer PR. This
one had been open for a while, and closing it with clean, working tests brought
both relief and quiet pride. Some threads take longer to tie, but they make the
fabric stronger when they finally do.

The final day came with a personal race against time. Balancing work with life’s
other responsibilities, I still chose to show up at the desk, commit pushed just
before midnight. And there was no pressure, just a quiet truth: I care about
this work, and I want to honour that care.

This week was about grounding and transition. A solid foundation set, and now
the flow can begin.

# Log 254: The Maze Deepens

> 27 Oct 2025

## What I Worked On

- Still [trying] to solve the test errors.

## Reflections

Today was frustrating.  
Actually, I’m being modest — it was _frustrating_. Period.

I picked up where I left off yesterday, tracing through the issue with the
unexpected `blinded_payinfo` in the dummy hop case. But fixing that opened a new
Pandora’s box — nearly eight new test failures. Now, instead of charging where
we shouldn’t, the system suddenly _isn’t_ charging where it should.

It feels like I’m deep inside a maze: every turn I take reveals more of the map,
but not the exit.  
Still, there’s a strange satisfaction in knowing I’m close — the answer feels
just out of reach, waiting for a shift in perspective.

Maybe tomorrow, that shift will come.  
For now, I’ll step back and let the code rest.

# Log 235: AAD's Here!

## What I Worked On

- [Finished] implementation of AAD-based verification for blinded payment paths.

## Reflections

After a long day of experimentation and focused effort, I finally got the
AAD-based verification for blinded payment paths working.

It’s a deeply satisfying moment—seeing the new, simpler verification approach
not just hold up, but land cleaner and faster than expected. The path-level AAD
strategy is now functional, elegant, and in place.

Today ends with a quiet sense of accomplishment—and the promise of a very
restful sleep after a well-earned win.

## What I Worked On

- [Furthered] discussion on the currency and event-model design

## Reflections

Today was focused on progressing the discussion around **currency** and the
**event-model**.

After a particularly helpful discussion earlier this week, I noticed something
interesting: the concerns raised about coupling currency with the event-model
actually apply to the event-model introduction _in general_. In particular, the
potential DoS risks exist whether the event-model is introduced in a
currency-coupled way or completely decoupled from it.

That realization reframed the problem for me. Rather than treating currency as
the primary source of risk, it suggests that the event-model itself needs
careful consideration, regardless of how currency support is layered on top.

I shared these thoughts on the PR and am looking forward to hearing the response
and continuing the discussion.

A good day of careful thinking and constructive brainstorming.

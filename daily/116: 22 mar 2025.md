- Reviewed
  [PR #3680](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3680#pullrequestreview-2708076279).

## Reflections:

Today was a great day! After a while, I dove into something both new and
familiar. I decided it was time to give another issue a shot, and picked
[#3043](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3043)—which
focuses on introducing a new `UserConfig`.

Here’s the context: LDK has several internal dust limits and feerate checks
which (understandably) err on the conservative side. But this sometimes causes
**unnecessary channel closures**, especially when the counterparty is a
**trusted LSP (Lightning Service Provider)**. The goal of this issue is to
**allow users to opt out of these conservative checks**, by enabling a
user-defined config that instructs LDK to skip certain validations when
appropriate. This could result in **smoother interactions and fewer false
positives**, especially in trusted setups.

On the review front, I tackled
[#3680](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3680)—a
fascinating PR. It addressed a subtle yet impactful logic bug. Originally, the
code ensured all individual MPP HTLCs had preimages before removing any HTLCs.
But the approach **tracked individual HTLCs**, while in reality,
**ChannelMonitor applies preimages across all HTLCs sharing the same payment
hash**, so **tracking per-channel** should suffice.

Interestingly, the current per-HTLC approach could cause a deadlock: if multiple
HTLCs for an MPP arrive on the same channel and a `revoke_and_ack` follows, the
channel may get stuck—waiting for a preimage claim that itself is waiting on the
`revoke_and_ack`.

Switching to **ChannelMonitor-level tracking** elegantly solves both the problem
and the race condition. The test setup also involved intricate **multithreading
scenarios**, making this a fun and intellectually engaging review.

Feeling proud to tick it off the list!

# Log 287: Threads of Progress

> 11 Dec 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Addressed] comments on payment dummy hops
- [Implemented] changes based on currency PR reviews

## Reflections

Today I focused on addressing the latest round of comments on the **dummy hops**
PR. This included improvements to the blinded path constructor — specifically
removing unnecessary cloning — and making the iterator creation cleaner and more
consistent throughout the function.

That work earned a fresh [LGTM][DummyHopsLGTM] from a senior reviewer (yay!),
and I’m optimistic we’re nearing the finish line for that PR.

In parallel, after a long wait, the **currency PR** finally received a batch of
thoughtful reviews. The comments helped smooth out some of the rougher edges
around how the `Currency` trait was introduced in the codebase. It’s good to see
this long-sleeping branch moving forward again.

Two branches, two different kinds of progress — and a satisfying day all around.

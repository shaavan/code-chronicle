# Log 219: Layers of Reasoning

> 27 August 2025

## What I Worked On

- [Discussed] nuances of Dummy Hops with mentor.
- [Documented] and expanded the rationale behind the IR Check PR.
- [Studied] updates and discussion on the Recurrence Spec PR.

## Reflections

The day began with a nuanced discussion on dummy hops with my mentor.

The suggestion on the table was to pad all blinded paths with dummy hops to the
same length. While this might sound like a solid abstraction strategy, it raises
a subtle privacy issue: if LDK is currently limited to producing blinded paths
with only one or two real hops, then always padding to a fixed length makes it
obvious how many are real. That predictability opens the door to graph
analysis—which defeats the purpose of dummy hops entirely.

We explored this concern and continued [discussing further points], leaving the
review pending.

After that, I turned my attention to documenting and refining the rationale
behind the _IR Check_ PR—clarifying its role as a precursor to the
currency-based event model. Writing that down helped me organize and solidify
the design story around it.

Finally, I reviewed responses in the _Recurrence Spec_ PR to get a clearer view
of the reasoning behind its direction.

An eventful day of reading, writing, and resisting leaky abstractions.

# Log 82: "Refining the Flow"

> 03 Feb 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Updated
  [`OffersMessageFlow`](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/pr3412.13).

## Reflections:

After helping review and merge
[#3576](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3576#pullrequestreview-2586932075),
I rebased `OffersMessageFlow` to incorporate the latest changes.

Beyond the expected `rustfmt` updates, I also spotted two newly introduced
functions in the **Offers** space that fit better in `flow.rs`. Moving them
helped streamline the structure and ensured they aligned naturally with the
flowâ€™s responsibilities.

A satisfying day of refining and improvingâ€”a great start to a new week! ðŸš€

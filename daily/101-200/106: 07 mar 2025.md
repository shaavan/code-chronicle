# Log 106: "Here's Something New!"

> 07 March 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Worked on a **new PR**:
  - [PR Link](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/i2274),
    addressing
    [Issue #2274](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2274).

## Reflections:

With **most of my previous work wrapped up**, I decided today was the perfect
time to dive into something new.

I picked up one of the **assigned issues in LDK** and spent the day hacking away
at it. The problem? **`PaymentClaimable` currently lists only one `channel_id`
of the previous node**, which isnâ€™t optimal for **MPP (Multipath
Payments)**â€”since multiple channels can technically act as the "previous node"
for different parts of the payment.

This PR aims to **expand `PaymentClaimable` to list all relevant
`channel_ids`**, making the field more accurate and useful.

Iâ€™m happy to report that the **technical implementation is complete!** Now, just
a few **documentation touch-ups remain**, which Iâ€™ll address soon.

**A fresh problem, a clean solutionâ€”feeling great about todayâ€™s progress! ðŸš€**

# Log 154: "A New Chapter Begins"

> 16 May 2025

## What I Worked On:

- Brainstormed the structure and design for Flow's upcoming follow-up features.

## Reflections:

With **Flow** now standing tall at the edge of merge, I took the first step into
its natural evolutionâ€”**currency support in Offers** and the introduction of a
**BOLT12 assessor**.

Today was about **exploration and structure**. I began mapping out how to
integrate these features through an **async, event-driven model**â€”where
user-configurable events get triggered based on enabled features. For instance,
when receiving an invoice request in a specific currency, the system would raise
an event that users can handle using their own custom logic.

The ideas are starting to take shape, and Iâ€™m excited to begin translating these
sketches into real code tomorrow.

A new chapter indeedâ€”and itâ€™s already starting to feel alive. ðŸš€

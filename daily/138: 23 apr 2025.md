# Log 138: "Dummies & Discussions"

> 23 April 2025

## What I Worked On:

- [Addressed](https://github.com/shaavan/rust-lightning/commits/dummy-03) Dummy
  Hops suggestions.
- Discussed Flow and Dummy Hops branch queries with peers.

## Reflections:

Today was a day spent **hacking at the code**, reaching that point where you
pause, sit with your peers, and open up the floor for **advice, questions, and
shared insights**.

First, I tackled a new approach to **Dummy Hops**—introducing a new TLV variant
that carries **its own authentication data**. The goal? To ensure no one can
send us arbitrarily long blinded paths filled with fake dummy hops that never
actually resolve to valid receive data.

After wiring up the variant, I noticed that while we could **theoretically
interpret** the dummy hop data, **something wasn’t clicking in practice**—the
parsing didn’t quite behave as expected. Unsure of the root cause, I decided it
was time to reach out. I shared my progress, findings, and open questions with a
peer, hoping to uncover what I might be missing.

Next, I dove back into **yesterday’s Flow mystery**, still chasing down the
reason behind that elusive test failure. This time, I reached out to the peer
who originally wrote the test—hoping their insight might help me connect the
final dots.

Today was about **planting the seeds of discussion**—and tomorrow, I look
forward to **reaping the harvest of clarity**.

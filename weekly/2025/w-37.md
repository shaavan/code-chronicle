# Weekly Log 37: The Edge of Design, The Edge of Self

> 05 – 08 September 2025

## Overview

This week was defined by two contrasting but deeply connected phases: patient
architectural refinement and high-velocity implementation.

Early in the week, I finalized the core field relationships for
recurrence—mapping out how offers, invoice requests, and invoices interlink
through time and index logic. This gave rise to deeper questions about
statelessness: what must LDK retain, and what can be reconstructed purely from
data?

That reflection laid the groundwork for what followed—a focused sprint that
culminated in implementing the full flow for accepting recurring payments. It
was a rare and rewarding moment of velocity, and a reminder of how much is
possible when clarity meets momentum.

## Highlights

- Finalized and mapped structural relationships between recurrence fields (e.g.,
  basetime, period index, time period).
- Explored the limits of stateless design within the recurrence model,
  identifying necessary persistent fields.
- [Implemented] the full flow for accepting recurring payments—from parsing and
  field wiring to compile-time validation and logic integration.

## Reflections

This week reinforced an idea I keep returning to: every moment of clarity in
system design pays off tenfold during implementation.

By the time I sat down to write code, the hard questions had already been
answered. That made it possible to move fast—and left me wondering how far my
capabilities really stretch when I’m fully aligned with the work.

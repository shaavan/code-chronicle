# Weekly Log 01: Opening the Gates

> 30 Dec 2025 – 06 Jan 2026

## Overview

This week marked a meaningful transition — closing out a long-running
implementation arc and opening the door for broader review and iteration. The
focus was on finishing, stabilizing, and finally presenting the **recurrence
payer flow**, bringing months of design and engineering work into a reviewable
form.

It also felt like a natural moment of reflection: wrapping up the year by
resolving lingering issues, and starting the new year by sharing work rather
than just building it.

## Highlights

### Recurrence Payer Flow — Completed and Opened

- Fixed remaining issues in payer-side invoice handling, including restoring
  safe access to the payer signing public key.
- Completed recurrence expiry logic, covering both count-based and time-based
  expiration paths.
- Tracked down and fixed a subtle lock-order violation affecting a single test.
- Finished the explicit signing mechanism, ensuring consistent payer identity
  across recurrence sessions.
- Polished the implementation and opened the **payer flow draft PR** for review.

### Review-Driven Cleanup

- Addressed final reviewer suggestions on **dummy hops**, incorporating feedback
  even during the holiday period.
- Used review feedback as an opportunity to reinforce correctness and improve
  internal safety checks.

### Year-End and Year-Beginning Reflection

- Closed out 2025 by tying up loose ends and reinforcing invariants.
- Began 2026 by shifting from solo implementation toward shared review,
  feedback, and iteration.

## Reflections

This week felt like standing at a threshold.

Much of the work was about _finishing_: resolving the last edge cases, fixing
the one remaining test, and choosing pragmatic solutions where perfection would
have stalled progress. Opening the payer flow PR wasn’t just a checkbox — it was
a moment of letting the work leave its private construction phase and enter a
collaborative one.

There’s a quiet satisfaction in that transition. The system now exists not just
in my head or on a branch, but as something others can read, question, and
improve.

As the first week of 2026, this feels like a strong place to start: with
momentum, clarity, and a gate now open to the next phase of the journey.
